Arnholt Last compiled: Jul 11, 2016 Chapter 1 Chapter 1.1 Overview Please watch the Course Introduction Video. This statistics course is presented in the service of a project of your choosing and will offer you an intensive hands-on experience in the quantitative research process. You will develop skills in 1) generating testable hypotheses; 2) understanding large data sets; 3) formatting and managing data; 4) conducting descriptive and inferential statistical analyses; and 5) presenting results for expert and novice audiences. It is designed for students who are interested in developing skills that are useful for working with data and using statistical tools to analyze them. No prior experience with data or statistics is required. Our approach is “statistics in the service of questions.” As such, the research question that you choose (from data sets made available to you) is of paramount importance to your learning experience. It must interest you enough that you will be willing to spend many hours thinking about it and analyzing data having to do with it. 1.2 Resources This course is unlike any you have likely encountered in that you will be driving the content and direction of your own learning. In many ways we will be asking more from you than any other introductory course ever has. To support you in this challenge, there are a number of useful resources. This Book: This book integrates the applied steps of a research project with the basic knowledge needed to meaningfully engage in quantitative research. Much of the background on descriptive and inferential statistics has been drawn from the Open Learning Initiative, a not-for-profit educational project aimed at transforming instruction and improving learning outcomes for students. Empowerment Through Statistical Computing: While there is widespread argument that introductory students need to learn statistical programming, opinions differ widely both within and across disciplines about the specific statistical software program that should be used. While many introductory statistics courses cover the practical aspects of using a single software package, our focus will be more generally on computing as a skill that will expand your capacity for statistical application and for engaging in deeper levels of quantitative reasoning. Instead of providing “canned” exercises for you to repeat, you will be provided with flexible syntax for achieving a host of data management and analytic tasks in the pursuit of answers to questions of greatest interest to you. Most importantly, syntax for R will be presented in the context of each step of the research process. Loads of Support: Through the in-class workshop sessions and peer group exchanges, a great deal of individualized support will be available to you. Taking advantage of this large amount of support means that you are succeeding in making the most of your experience in this course. GitHub Repository: To provide reliable backup of your work, you will use a private GitHub repository. While you will have read/write access to your own repository, you will also have read access to all public repositories in the organization (Course). Aside from providing a centralized way to share files, GitHub is meant to function as a resource in support of collaboration. Put simply, our hope is that you work together! 1.3 An Introduction to Statistics1 Statistics plays a significant role across the physical and social sciences and is arguably the most salient point of intersection between diverse disciplines given that researchers constantly communicate information on varied topics through the common language of statistics. In a nutshell, what statistics is all about is converting data into useful information. Statistics is therefore a process where we are: Collecting Data Summarizing Data, and Interpreting Data The process of statistics starts when we identify what group we want to study or learn something about. We call this group the population. Note the word “population” here (and in the entire course) is not just used to refer to people; it is used in the more broad statistical sense, where population can refer not only to people, but also to animals, things, etc. For example, we might be interested in: The opinions of the population of U.S. adults about the death penalty How the population of mice react to a certain chemical The average price of the population of all one-bedroom apartments in a certain city Population, then, is the entire group that is the target of our interest. In most cases, the population is so large that as much as we want to, there is absolutely no way that we can study all of it (imagine trying to get opinions of all U.S. adults about the death penalty…). A more practical approach would be to examine and collect data only from a sub-group of the population, which we call a sample. We call this first step, which involves choosing a sample and collecting data from it, Producing Data. Since, for practical reasons, we need to compromise and examine only a sub-group of the population rather than the whole population, we should make an effort to choose a sample in such a way that it will represent the population as well. For example, if we choose a sample from the population of U.S. adults, and ask their opinions about the death penalty, we do not want our sample to consist of only Republicans or only Democrats. Once the data have been collected, what we have is a long list of answers to questions, or numbers, and in order to explore and make sense of the data, we need to summarize that list in a meaningful way. This second step, which consists of summarizing the collected data, is called Exploratory Data Analysis. Now we’ve obtained the sample results and summarized them, but we are not done. Remember that our goal is to study the population, so what we want is to be able to draw conclusions about the population based on the sample results. Before we can do so, we need to look at how the sample we’re using may differ from the population as a whole, so that we can factor that into our analysis. Finally, we can use what we’ve discovered about our sample to draw conclusions about our population. We call this final step Inference. This is the Big Picture of Statistics. Since we will be relying on data that has already been produced, the focus of your individual project will be exploratory and inferential data analysis. Example At the end of April 2005, a poll was conducted (by ABC News and the Washington Post), for the purpose of learning the opinions of U.S. adults about the death penalty. Producing Data: A (representative) sample of 1,082 U.S. adults was chosen, and each adult was asked whether he or she favored or opposed the death penalty. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The collected data was summarized, and it was found that 65% of the sample’s adults favor the death penalty for persons convicted of murder. Inference: Based on the sample result (of 65% favoring the death penalty), it was concluded (within 95% confidence) that the percentage of those who favor the death penalty in the population is within 3% of what was obtained in the sample (i.e., between 62% and 68%). The following figure summarizes the example: Final Notes: Statistics education is often conducted within a discipline specific context or as generic mathematical training. Our goal is instead to create meaningful dialogue across disciplines. Ultimately, this experience is aimed at helping you on your way to engaging in interdisciplinary scholarship at the highest levels. https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=434b846480020ca6018dda7ea62a2528↩ "],
["chapter-1.html", "Chapter 2 Chapter 2.1 Data Sets 2.2 Code Books", " Chapter 2 Chapter 2.1 Data Sets Please watch the Chapter 02 video. Since we will not be producing data for this course, the first step of your project will be to choose a data set (from those made available) that offers the opportunity to conduct research on a general topic that will be of significant interest to you. A full list will be presented in class. Here are a few examples: The U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) is representative school-based survey of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States. (Wave I and Wave IV) The U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) is a survey designed to determine the magnitude of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders in the U.S. population. It is a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population 18 years and older. The Mars Craters Study (http://craters.sjrdesign.net) created by Stuart Robbins, presents a global database that includes over 300,000 Mars craters 1 km or larger. Heavily cratered terrain on Mars was created between 4.2 and 3.8 billion years ago during a period of heavy bombardment (i.e. impacts of asteroids, proto-planets, and comets). Mars craters allow inferences into the ancient climate of Mars, and they add a key data point for the understanding of impact physics. Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is the primary source for data on colleges, universities, and technical and vocational postsecondary institutions in the United States. Outlook On Life Surveys (OOL) 2.2 Code Books Before accessing any data, you will be reviewing the available codebooks (sometimes called “data dictionaries”). Codebooks commonly offer complete information regarding the data set (e.g. general topics addressed, questions and/or measurements used, and in some cases the frequency of responses or values). Reviewing a code book is always the first step in research based on existing data since 1) code books can be used to generate research questions; and 2) data is generally useless and uninterpretable without it. The code book describes how the data are arranged in the computer file or files, what the various numbers and letters mean, and any special instructions on how to use the data properly. Like any other kind of book, some codebooks are better than others. Selecting A Data Set At this point, you should review the available codebooks for the data set that most interests you. The PDS2 R package has the codebooks and data sets for this course. Selecting A Data Set Assignment Select a data set that you will work with. Add the abbreviated title of that data set (i.e. AddHealth, NESARC, Mars Crater, IPEDS, or OOL) to the README file of your GitHub repository. https://github.com/alanarnholt/PDS↩ "],
["chapter-2.html", "Chapter 3 Chapter", " Chapter 3 Chapter Data Architecture3—What do we really mean by data? Data are pieces of information about individuals or observations organized into variables. By an individual or observation, we mean a particular person or object. By a variable, we mean a particular characteristic of the individual or observation. A dataset is a collection of information, usually presented in tabular form. Each column represents a particular variable. Each row corresponds to a given individual (or observation) within the dataset. Relying on datasets, statistics pulls all of the behavioral, physical and social sciences together. It’s arguably the one language that we all have in common. While you may think that data is very, very different from discipline to discipline, it is not. What you measure is different, and your research question is obviously dramatically different; whom you observe and whom you collect data from – or what you collect data from – can be very different, but once you have the data, approaches to analyzing it statistically are quite similar regardless of individual discipline. Example: Medical Recordings The following dataset shows medical records from a particular survey: In this example, the individuals are patients, and the variables are Gender, Age, Weight, Height, Smoking, and Race. Each row, then, gives us all the information about a particular individual or observation (in this case, patient), and each column gives us the information about a particular characteristic of all the patients. Variables can be classified into one of two types: quantitative or categorical. Quantitative Variables take numerical values and represent some kind of measurement Categorical Variables take category or label values and place an individual into one of several groups. In our example of medical records, there are several variables of each type: Age, Weight, and Height are quantitative variables Race, Gender, and Smoking are categorical variables Notice that the values of the categorical variable, Smoking, have been coded as the numbers 0 or 1. It is quite common to code the values of a categorical variable as numbers, but you should remember that these are just codes (often called dummy codes). They have no arithmetic meaning (i.e., it does not make sense to add, subtract, multiply, divide, or compare the magnitude of such values.) A unique identifier is a variable that is meant to distinctively define each of the individuals or observations in your data set. Examples might include serial numbers (for data on a particular product), social security numbers (for data on individual persons), or random numbers (generated for any type of observations). Every data set should have a variable that uniquely identifies the observations. In this example, the patient number (1 through 75) is a unique identifier. Medical Records Assignment Although you will be working with previously collected data, it is important to understand what data looks like as well as how it is coded and entered into a spreadsheet or dataset for analysis. Using medical records for 5 patients seeking treatment in a hospital emergency room. Select 4 variables recorded on the medical forms (one should be a unique identifier, at least one should be a quantitative variable and at least one should be a categorical variable) Select a brief name (ideally 8 characters or less) for each variable Determine what range of values is needed for recording each variable (create dummy codes as needed) Label variables within an Excel spreadsheet Enter data for each patient in the Excel spreadsheet List the variable names, labels, types, and, response codes below the data set (i.e. the code book). Push the Excel spreadsheet to your private GitHub repository. Model: Personal Code Book (AKA Research Question) Assignment One of the simplest research questions that can be asked is whether two constructs are associated. For example: a) Is medical treatment seeking associated with socio-economic status? Is water fluorination associated with number of cavities during dentist visits? Is humidity associated with caterpillar reproduction? Example: After looking through the codebook for the NESARC study, I have decided that I am particularly interested in nicotine dependence. I am not sure which variables I will use regarding nicotine dependence (e.g. symptoms or diagnosis) so for now I will include all of the relevant variables in my personal codebook. At this point, you should continue to explore the code book for the data set you have selected. After choosing a data set, you should: Identify a specific topic of interest Prepare a codebook of your own (i.e., print individual pages (or copy screen and paste into a new document) from the larger codebook that includes the questions/items/variables that measure your selected topics.) Example: While nicotine dependence is a good starting point, I need to determine what it is about nicotine dependence that I am interested in. It strikes me that friends and acquaintances that I have known through the years that became hooked on cigarettes did so across very different periods of time. Some seemed to be dependent soon after their first few experiences with smoking and others after many years of generally irregular smoking behavior. I decide that I am most interested in exploring the association between level of smoking and nicotine dependence. I add to my codebook variables reflecting smoking levels (e.g. smoking quantity and frequency). During a second review of the codebook for the dataset that you have selected, you should: Identify a second topic that you would like to explore in terms of its association with your original topic Add questions/items/variables documenting this second topic to your personal codebook. Following completion of the steps described above, show your instructor and peer mentor (in class) a hard copy of your personal codebook. Keep this in a folder or binder for your own use throughout the course. https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=434b846d80020ca60084af88b54dce2b↩ "],
["chapter-3.html", "Chapter 4 Chapter 4.1 Conducting a Literature Review 4.2 Literature Review", " Chapter 4 Chapter 4.1 Conducting a Literature Review At this point you have (1) generated a personal codebook reflecting variables of interest to you from your data set; and (2) selected an association that you would like to test. You are now ready to conduct a literature review using primary source journal articles (i.e. those reporting original research findings). This video describes the nature and content of primary source journal articles. It highlights the importance of conducting a literature review before initiating a research project. You should start your search using key words based on the two topics you have selected (note: search for their presence in the title of articles). You can then narrow your search as necessary based on the amount of relevant literature that you find. Although some libraries have extensive paper collections of journals, you should focus on articles available online. Secondary source literature including review articles and theoretical papers should be used only for needed background on a topic. It is important to identify and review primary sources either through your on-line search or by using the reference list from primary or secondary sources. It may also be useful to limit your search to journal articles published in the past 5 years. Note that as you read the literature, there should be an exchange between your research question and what you are learning. The literature review may cause you to add to the complexity of your research question, further focus that question, or even abandon the question for another. 4.2 Literature Review During your literature review, you should: Identify primary source articles that address the association that you have decided to examine Download relevant articles. Read the articles that seem to test the association most directly. Identify replicated and equivocal findings in order to generate a more focused question that may add to the literature. Give special attention to the “future research” sections of the articles that you read Based on the literature, select additional questions/items/ variables that may help you to understand the association of interest. In doing so, further refine your research question. Add relevant documentation (i.e. code book pages) to your personal codebook. Example: Given the association that I have decided to examine, I use such keywords as nicotine dependence, tobacco dependence, and smoking. After reading through several titles and abstracts, I notice that there has been relatively little attention in the research literature to the association between smoking exposure and nicotine dependence. I expand a bit to include other substance use that provides relevant background as well. References: Caraballo, R. S., Novak, S. P., &amp; Asman, K. (2009).

Based on my reading of the above articles as well as others, I have noted a few common and interesting themes: While it is true that smoking exposure is a necessary requirement for nicotine dependence, frequency and quantity of smoking are markedly imperfect indices for determining an individual’s probability of exhibiting nicotine dependence (this is true for other drugs as well) The association may differ based on ethnicity, age, and gender (although there is little work on this) One of the most potent risk factors consistently implicated in the etiology of smoking behavior and nicotine dependence is depression I have decided to further focus my question by examining whether the association between nicotine dependence and depression differs based on how much a person smokes. I am wondering if at low levels of smoking compared to high levels, nicotine dependence is more common among individuals with major depression than those without major depression. I add relevant depression questions/items/variables to my personal codebook as well as several demographic measures (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) and any other variables I may wish to consider.

["chapter-4.html", "Chapter 5 Chapter", " Chapter 5 Chapter Writing About Empirical Research The goal of research is to disseminate your work and allow it to guide further study. As such, writing is an important and ongoing part of the research process. Successful empirical writing minimizes descriptive or complex language so methodologies, conclusions, and theories are accessible to readers from all areas of expertise. Although this sounds easy, it is difficult to write clearly and concisely especially when writing an empirical paper for the first time. What follows is information about how you should structure your paper, so you can focus on precise writing. We offer advice on how to write each section of a research proposal for an empirical paper; we discuss how to use evidence and sources in empirical writing; finally, we present conventions for empirical writing. Writing a Research Proposal for Empirical Research An empirical paper has six sections: title and abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and references. A research proposal often has five sections: title, introduction, methodology, predicted results or implications, and references. Both paper types should have an “hourglass” shape: introduce broad statements, narrow to specific methodologies, and conclusions, and then broaden again to discuss the general significance and implications of your work. Thus, the beginning of your introduction and end of your discussion should contain your broadest statements, and the methodology and results sections should contain your most specific statements. Title A title should summarize the main idea of your research question. It should be a concise statement of the main topic and should identify the actual variables under investigation and the relationship between them. An example of a good title is “The association between weather patterns and caterpillar reproduction”. A title should be fully explanatory when standing alone. You should avoid words that serve no useful purpose. For example, the words “method” and “results” do not normally appear in a title, nor should such redundancies as “A Study of” or “An Experimental Investigation of” begin a title. Also, do not use causal language, for example, “the impact of”, “the effect of”, etc. Finally, avoid using abbreviations in a title. Model Title: The Association between Nicotine Dependence and Major Depression at Different Levels of Smoking Exposure Introduction The introduction describes the question you intend to investigate and how your research relates to other work in the field. It comprises opening statements and a literature review. Opening Statements. Opening statements introduce your topic and rationale for study but are accessible to both non-specialists and specialists. Successful opening statements gradually introduce your topic with examples and explicit, if nontechnical, definitions of crucial terms. Avoid introducing the formal theory if one motivates your research and jargon specific to your topic; doing so makes your introduction seem forbidding to non-specialists and intellectually masturbatory to specialists. However, oversimplifying your opening statements will make your introduction seem condescending to non-specialists and boring to specialists. Literature Review. The literature review summarizes the state of the field you investigate. Each statement in the literature review should build to the justification of your own research by identifying a hole in existing scholarship. Emphasize major findings and key conclusions rather than citing tangentially related works. Assume your reader is basically knowledgeable about your topic rather than writing an exhaustive review. The following is a successful section of a literature review: Through to the mid-1990s, most research suggested that academic censorship reduced college students’ respect for authority. However, results were inconsistent. In a landmark two-year case study of college student social dynamics, Jones (1996) found that college students’ respect for authority declined significantly after censorship was imposed. Jones relied exclusively on objective measures rather than self-reported measures of respect for authority. Observe that the first two sentences identify trends in the literature, the third sentence emphasizes major findings, and the fourth sentence suggests gaps in the literature that the present study will fill. Moreover, this literature review is successful because it summarizes findings and can be understood by specialists and non-specialists alike. Strive for this level of precision in your literature review. Important: The main evidence used in an empirical paper is data. Opinions and paraphrased statements, even if they corroborate your claim, are not evidence unless accompanied by empirical results. The main sources used in an empirical paper are primary sources such as journal articles. When researching a topic, use the literature review and references sections of secondary sources to find primary sources related to your topic. When searching online databases, look for articles that have been cited by other authors. It is important to note that the literature review is an argument that sets the stage for your research question. It is not an exhaustive review of research details. Research Questions. Your introduction should build to and conclude with the research questions or study objectives that you will address. Model Introduction: One of the most potent risk factors consistently implicated in both the etiology of smoking behavior as well as the subsequent development of nicotine dependence is major depression. Evidence for this association comes from longitudinal investigations in which depression has been shown to increase risk of later smoking (Breslau, Peterson, Schultz, Chilcoat, &amp; Andreski, 1998; Dierker, Avenevoli, Merikangas, Flaherty, &amp; Stolar, 2001). This temporal ordering suggests the possibility of a causal relationship. In fact, the vast majority of research to date has focused on the role of major depression in increasing the probability and amount of smoking (Dierker, Avenevoli, Goldberg, &amp; Glantz, 2004; Rohde, Kahler, Lewinsohn, &amp; Brown, 2004; Rohde, Lewinsohn, Brown, Gau, &amp; Kahler, 2003). While it is true that smoking exposure is a necessary requirement for nicotine dependence, frequency and quantity of smoking are markedly imperfect indices for determining an individual’s probability of developing nicotine dependence (Kandel &amp; Chen, 2000; Stanton, Lowe, &amp; Silva, 1995). For example, a substantial number of individuals reporting daily and/or heavy smoking do not meet criteria for nicotine dependence (Kandel &amp; Chen, 2000). Conversely, nicotine dependence has been seen among population subgroups reporting relatively low levels of daily and non daily smoking (Kandel &amp; Chen, 2000). A complementary or alternate role that major depression may play is as a cause or signal of greater sensitivity to nicotine dependence, over and above an individual’s level of smoking exposure. While major depression has been shown to increase an individual’s probability of smoking initiation, regular use and nicotine dependence, it remains unclear whether it may signal greater sensitivity for nicotine dependence regardless of smoking quantity. The present study will examine young adults from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The goals of the analysis will include 1) establishing the relationship between major depression and nicotine dependence; and 2) determining whether or not the relationship between major depression and nicotine dependence exists above and beyond smoking quantity. Methods The methods section describes how the research was conducted. It comprises discussions of your sample, measures, and procedures. Sample. Identify who or what was studied (people, animals, etc.). Identify the level of analysis studied (individual, group, or aggregate). Describe observations vividly so your reader can distinguish them clearly. If you group observations, use meaningful names (Low-Income Women) rather than abbreviations (PPM100) or labels (Control Group). The following is successful section of a sample description: The sample of 1,203 pregnant women was drawn from two public prenatal clinics in Texas and Maryland. The ethnic composition was African American (\\(n = 414, 34.4\\)%), Hispanic, primarily Mexican American (\\(n = 412, 34.2\\)%), and White (\\(n = 377, 31.3\\)%). Most women were between the ages of 20 and 29 years; 30% were teenagers. All were urban residents, and most (94%) had incomes below the poverty level as defined using each state’s criteria for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) eligibility. This sample description is successful because it identifies both the observations (1,203 pregnant women) and the location (two prenatal clinics in Texas and Maryland). Furthermore, it describes the composition of the group ethnically and by income using language consistent with writing standards for the empirical research. Procedures. Explain what participants/observations experienced. Discuss whether data were collected by surveillance, survey, case study, or another method. Discuss where data were collected and the period over which they were collected. Mention observations discarded during data collection in this section, but discuss observations discarded during data analysis in the results section. If appropriate, comment on the reliability of data collection here, rather than in the discussion. The following is a successful section of a procedures discussion: Random sampling was used to recruit participants for this study. Surveyors went to considerable lengths to secure a high completion rate, including up to four call-backs, letters, and in some cases monetary incentives. Trained research assistants conducted face-to-face interviews with all study participants. This procedures description is successful because it describes how the sample was collected (a random survey), which observations were discarded (surveys incomplete after callbacks, letters, and incentives), and how data were collected (during interviews). Conclude your methodology section with a summary of your procedure and its overall purpose. Measures. Describe the questions or measures of your participants/observations and relate these to the type of data you collected (quantitative or categorical). The following is a successful section of a measures discussion: Attitude toward school was measured with a questionnaire developed for use in this study. It contains nine statements. The first three measure attitudes toward academic subjects; the next three measure attitudes toward teachers, counselors, and administrators; the last three measure attitudes toward the social environment in the school. Participants were asked to rate each statement on a five-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This measures discussion is successful because it indicates how attitudes were measured (ranking on a five-point scale). Model Methods: Sample The sample from the first wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) represents the civilian, non-institutionalized adult population of the United States, and includes persons living in households, military personnel living off base, and persons residing in the following group quarters: boarding or rooming houses, non-transient hotels and motels, shelters, facilities for housing workers, college quarters, and group homes. The NESARC included over sampling of Blacks, Hispanics and young adults aged 18 to 24 years. The sample included 43,093 participants. Procedure One adult was selected for interview in each household, and face-to-face computer assisted interviews were conducted in respondents’ homes following informed consent procedures. Measures Lifetime major depression (i.e. those experienced in the past 12 months and prior to the past 12 months) were assessed using the NIAAA, Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule – DSM-IV (AUDADIS-IV) (Grant et al., 2003; Grant, Harford, Dawson, &amp; Chou, 1995). The tobacco module of the AUDADIS-IV contains detailed questions on the frequency, quantity, and patterning of tobacco use as well as symptom criteria for DSM- IV nicotine dependence. Current smoking was evaluated through both smoking frequency (“About how often did you usually smoke in the past year?”) coded dichotomously in terms of the presence or absence of daily smoking, and quantity (“On the days that you smoked in the last year, about how many cigarettes did you usually smoke?”). Predicted Results or Implications ￼It is important that this section includes real implications linked to possible results. Often writers use this section to merely state their research question. This is an important section of a research proposal and sometimes best written after you’ve had a few days to step away from your paper and allow yourself to put your question (and possible answers) into perspective. Model Implications: While chronic use is a key feature in the development of dependence, the present study will evaluate whether individual differences in nicotine dependence exist above and beyond level of exposure. If individuals with major depression are more sensitive to the development of nicotine dependence regardless of how much they smoke, they would represent an important population subgroup for targeted smoking intervention programs.

Clearly explain your claims, your evidence, and how your evidence supports your claims. In each section, allude to your next section. Avoid direct quotations. Instead, summarize other authors’ work. Include the name and year of an author in-line and include their work in your references section. Avoid language bias. Refer to people as those people refer to themselves. For a study, use “participants” rather than “subjects.” Be succinct. Excise unnecessary words and sentences. Revise liberally. Avoid jargon. Use jargon only if it more accurately denotes and connotes your meaning. Otherwise, use English. Define jargon explicitly, implicitly, or by example. Voice. Use “I” and “We” sparingly (or ideally, never) and only to refer to the authors of a paper. Note that every primary source article that you read as you conduct your literature review is a model of the kind of writing you are trying to accomplish. Campus Resources The Writing Program at Appalachian State University offers a variety of excellent services. Tutors in the Writing Workshop can assist students at any stage of the writing process. Students seeking extra assistance are encouraged to apply for a Writing Mentor. Details about the Writing Program are available at: http://writingcenter.appstate.edu/ Research Plan Assignment You will spend the next three weeks writing your research plan.

["chapter-5.html", "Chapter 6 Chapter", " Chapter 6 Chapter Working with Data Now that you have a research question, it is time to look at the data. Raw data consist of long lists of numbers and/or labels that are not very informative. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is how we make sense of the data by converting them from their raw form to a more informative one. In particular, EDA consists of: Organizing and summarizing the raw data, Discovering important features and patterns in the data and any striking deviations from those patterns, and then Interpreting our findings in the context of the problem We begin EDA by looking at one variable at a time (also known as univariate analysis). In order to convert raw data into useful information we need to summarize and then examine the distribution of any variables of interest. By distribution of a variable, we mean: What values the variable takes, and How often the variable takes those values Statistical Software When working with data with more than just a few observations and/or variables requires specialized software. The use of syntax (or formal code) in the context of statistical software is a central skill that we will be teaching you in this course. We believe that it will greatly expand your capacity not only for statistical application but also for engaging in deeper levels of quantitative reasoning about data. Writing Your First Program Empirical research is all about making decisions (the best ones possible with the information at hand). Please watch the Chapter 06 video. This will get you thinking about some of the earliest decisions you will need to make when working with your data (i.e. selecting columns and possibly rows). Working with Data Lab This week, you will learn how to call in a dataset, select the columns (i.e. variables), and possibly rows (i.e. observations), of interest, and run frequency distributions for your chosen variables. Read the PDS vignette to see examples of subsetting your data, renaming variables, coding missing values, collapsing categories, creating a factor from a numeric vector, aggregating variables using ifelse, creating a new variable with mutate, etc. RStudio has several cheat sheets available at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/. You may find the data wrangling cheat sheet and the data visualization cheat sheet useful for the working with data assignment.

["chapter-6.html", "Chapter 7 Chapter 7.1 Data Management4 7.2 Data Management with R", " Chapter 7 Chapter 7.1 Data Management4 Examining frequency distributions for each of your variables is the key to further guiding the decision making involved in quantitative research. EXAMPLE: A random sample of 1,200 U.S. college students were asked the following questions as part of a larger survey: “What is your perception of your own body? Do you feel that you are overweight, underweight, or about right?” The following table shows part of the data (5 of the 1200 observations); STUDENT BODY IMAGE Student 25 Overweight Student 26 About Right Student 27 Underweight Student 28 About Right Student 29 About Right Here is some information that would be interesting to get from these data: What percentage of the sampled students fall into each category? How are students divided across the three body image categories? Are they equally divided? If not, do the percentages follow some other kind of pattern? There is no way that we can answer these questions by looking at the raw data, which are in the form of a long list of 1,200 responses and thus not very useful. However, both these questions will be easily answered once we summarize and look at the frequency distribution of the variable BodyImage (i.e., once we summarize how often each of the categories occurs). In order to summarize the distribution of a categorical variable, we ask our statistical software program to create a table of the different values (categories) the variable takes, how many times each value occurs (count), and, more importantly, how often each value occurs (percentages). Here is the table (i.e. frequency distribution) for our example: Table 7.1: Body Image Distribution CATEGORY COUNT PERCENTAGE About Right 855 71.3% Overweight 235 19.6% Underweight 110 9.2% Total 1200 100% Please watch the Chapter 07 video. 7.2 Data Management with R During the class session, we will begin to work through how to make decisions about data management and how to put those decisions into action. An understanding of basic operations to be used with your statistical software is a good place to start. In R, logical operators include ! (not), &amp; and &amp;&amp; (logical AND), | and || (logical OR). Relational operators in R include &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), &lt;= (less than or equal), == (vector equality), and != (not equal). Examples: 1. Need to identify missing data Often, you must define the response categories that represent missing data. For example, if the number 9 is used to represent a missing value, you must either designate in your program that this value represents missingness or else you must recode the variable into a missing data character that your statistical software recognizes. If you do not, the 9 will be treated as a real/meaningful value and will be included in each of your analyses. &gt; title_of_data_set$VAR1[title_of_data_set$VAR1 == 9] &lt;- NA 2. Need to recode responses to “no” based on skip patterns There are a number of skip outs in some data sets. For example, if we ask someone whether or not they have ever used marijuana, and they say “no”, it would not make sense to ask them more detailed questions about their marijuana use (e.g. quantity, frequency, onset, ￼￼impairment, etc.). When analyzing more detailed questions regarding marijuana (e.g. have you ever smoked marijuana daily for a month or more?), those individuals that never used the substance may show up as missing data. Since they have never used marijuana, we can assume that their answer is “no”, they have never smoked marijuana daily. This would need to be explicitly recoded. Note that we commonly code a no as 0 and a yes as 1. &gt; title_of_data_set$VAR1[is.na(title_of_data_set$VAR1)] &lt;- 0 3. Need to collapse response categories If a variable has many response categories, it can be difficult to interpret the statistical analyses in which it is used. Alternatively, there may be too few subjects or observations identified by one or more response categories to allow for a successful analysis. In these cases, you would need to collapse across categories. Consider the variable S1Q6A from the data frame NESARC which has 14 levels that record the highest level of education of the participant. To collapse the categories into a dichotomous variable that indicates the presence of a high school degree, use the ifelse function. The levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the variable S1Q6A correspond to education levels less than completing high school. &gt; library(PDS) &gt; NESARC$HS_DEGREE &lt;- factor(ifelse(NESARC$S1Q6A %in% c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;), &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;)) &gt; summary(NESARC$HS_DEGREE) No Yes 7849 35244 4. Need to aggregate variables In many cases, you will want to combine multiple variables into one. Consider creating create a new variable DepressLife which is Yes if the variable MAJORLIFE or DYSLIFE is a 1 (data frame NESARC). &gt; NESARC$DepressLife &lt;- factor(ifelse( (NESARC$MAJORDEPLIFE == 1 | NESARC$DYSLIFE == 1), &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;)) &gt; summary(NESARC$DepressLife) No Yes 34894 8199 5. Need to create continuous variables If you are working with a number of items that represent a single construct, it may be useful to create a composite variable/score. For example, I want to use a list of nicotine dependence symptoms meant to address the presence or absence of nicotine dependence (e.g. tolerance, withdrawal, craving, etc.). Rather than using a dichotomous variable (i.e. nicotine dependence present/absent), I want to examine the construct as a dimensional scale (i.e. number of nicotine dependence symptoms). In this case, I would want to recode each symptom variable so that yes=1 and no=0 and then sum the items so that they represent one composite score. &gt; nd_sum &lt;- title_of_data_set$nd_symptom1 + title_of_data_set$nd_symptom2 + title_of_data_set$nd_symptom3 &gt; title_of_data_set$nd_sum &lt;- nd_sum 6. Labeling variable responses/values Given that nominal and ordinal variables have, or are given numeric response values (i.e. dummy codes), it can be useful to label those values so that the labels are displayed in your output. &gt; levels(title_of_data_set$VARIABLE) &lt;- c(&quot;value&quot;, &quot;value&quot;) 7. Need to further subset the sample When using large data sets, it is often necessary to subset the data so that you are including only those observations that can assist in answering your particular research question. In these cases, you may want to select your own sample from within the survey’s sampling frame. For example, if you are interested in identifying demographic predictors of depression among Type II diabetes patients, you would plan to subset the data to subjects endorsing Type II Diabetes. &gt; title_of_subsetted_data &lt;- title_of_data_set[&quot;diabetes2&quot; == 1, ] &gt; # OR using dplyr &gt; library(dplyr) &gt; title_of_subsetted_data &lt;- filter(title_of_data_set, &quot;diabetes2&quot; == 1) Three different approaches to subsetting data will be illustrated. The first approach is to use the dplyr function filter; the second approach is to use indices; and the third approach is to use the function subset. Consider creating a subset of the NESARC data set where a person indicates He/she has smoked over 100 cigarettes (S3AQ1A == 1) He/she has smoked in the past year (CHECK321 == 1) He/she has typically smoked every day over the last year (S3AQ3B1 == 1) He/she is less than or equal to 25 years old (AGE &lt;= 25) The first approach uses the filter function with the %&gt;% function. Although it is not a requirement, the data frame NESARC is converted to a data frame tbl per the advice given in the dplyr vignette. library(PDS) library(dplyr) NESARCsub1 &lt;- tbl_df(NESARC) %&gt;% filter(S3AQ1A == 1 &amp; CHECK321 == 1 &amp; S3AQ3B1 == 1 &amp; AGE &lt;= 25) dim(NESARCsub1) [1] 1320 3010 The second approach uses standard indexing. NESARCsub2 &lt;- NESARC[NESARC$S3AQ1A == 1 &amp; NESARC$CHECK321 == 1 &amp; NESARC$S3AQ3B1 == 1 &amp; NESARC$AGE &lt;= 25, ] dim(NESARCsub2) [1] 1320 3010 The third approach uses the subset function. NESARCsub3 &lt;- subset(NESARC, subset = S3AQ1A == 1 &amp; CHECK321 == 1 &amp; S3AQ3B1 == 1 &amp; AGE &lt;= 25) dim(NESARCsub3) [1] 1320 3010 NOTE: Often, you will need to create groups or sub-samples from the data set for the purpose of making comparisons. It is important to be certain that the groups that you would like to compare are of adequate size and number. For example, if you were interested in comparing complications of depression in parents who had lost a child through miscarriage vs. parents who had lost a child in the first year of life, it would be important to have large enough groups of each. It would not be appropriate to attempt to compare 5000 observations in the miscarriage group to only 9 observations in the first year group. Extended Example Use the data frame NESARC and create a new variable (NumberNicotineSymptoms) that is the sum of all of the nicotine dependence symptoms where a person indicates He/she has smoked over 100 cigarettes (S3AQ1A == 1) He/she has smoked in the past year (CHECK321 == 1) He/she has typically smoked every day over the last year (S3AQ3B1 == 1) He/she is less than or equal to 25 years old (AGE &lt;= 25) The following code selects the 67 variables that deal with nicotine dependence using the select and contains functions from dplyr. The ifelse function is used in the myfix function to convert values of 2 and 9 to 0. library(PDS) library(dplyr) DF &lt;- tbl_df(NESARC) %&gt;% filter(S3AQ1A ==1 &amp; S3AQ3B1 == 1 &amp; CHECK321 == 1 &amp; AGE &lt;= 25) %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;S3AQ8&quot;)) myfix &lt;- function(x){ifelse(x %in% c(2, 9), 0, ifelse(x == 1, 1, NA))} DF2 &lt;- as.data.frame(apply(DF, 2, myfix)) DF2$NumberNicotineSymptoms &lt;- apply(DF2, 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE) nesarc &lt;- tbl_df(NESARC) %&gt;% filter(S3AQ1A ==1 &amp; S3AQ3B1 == 1 &amp; CHECK321 == 1 &amp; AGE &lt;= 25) %&gt;% rename(Ethnicity = ETHRACE2A, Age = AGE, MajorDepression = MAJORDEPLIFE, Sex = SEX, TobaccoDependence = TAB12MDX, DailyCigsSmoked = S3AQ3C1, AlcoholAD = ALCABDEPP12DX) %&gt;% select(Ethnicity, Age, MajorDepression, TobaccoDependence, DailyCigsSmoked, Sex, AlcoholAD) nesarc &lt;- data.frame(nesarc, NumberNicotineSymptoms = DF2$NumberNicotineSymptoms) nesarc &lt;- tbl_df(nesarc) # Code 99 properly nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked[nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked == 99] &lt;- NA # Create smoking categories nesarc$DCScat &lt;- cut(nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 98), include.lowest = FALSE) # Label factors nesarc$Ethnicity &lt;- factor(nesarc$Ethnicity, labels = c(&quot;Caucasian&quot;, &quot;African American&quot;, &quot;Native American&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot;, &quot;Hispanic&quot;)) nesarc$TobaccoDependence &lt;- factor(nesarc$TobaccoDependence, labels = c(&quot;No Nicotine Dependence&quot;, &quot;Nicotine Dependence&quot;)) nesarc$Sex &lt;- factor(nesarc$Sex, labels =c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;)) nesarc$MajorDepression &lt;- factor(nesarc$MajorDepression, labels =c(&quot;No Depression&quot;, &quot;Yes Depression&quot;)) nesarc$AlcoholAD &lt;- factor(nesarc$AlcoholAD, labels = c(&quot;No Alcohol&quot;, &quot;Alcohol Abuse&quot;, &quot;Alcohol Dependence&quot;, &quot;Alcohol Abuse and Dependence&quot;)) # dim(nesarc) [1] 1320 9 See the PDS vignette for additional examples.

Consider the data frame EPIDURALF from the PASWR2 package which records intermediate results from a study to determine whether the traditional sitting position or the hamstring stretch position is superior for administering epidural anesthesia to pregnant women in labor as measured by the number of obstructive (needle to bone) contacts. In this study, there were four physicians. To summarize the number of patients treated by each physician we can use the function xtabs. library(PASWR2) xtabs(~doctor, data = EPIDURALF) doctor A B C D 61 115 93 73 A barplot of the number of patients treated by each physician (doctor) using ggplot2 is constructed below. library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = EPIDURALF, aes(x = doctor)) + geom_bar(fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + theme_bw() Here is some information that would be interesting to get from these data: What percentage of the patients were treated by each physician? prop.table(xtabs(~doctor, data = EPIDURALF)) doctor A B C D 0.1783626 0.3362573 0.2719298 0.2134503 How are patients divided across physicians? Are they equally divided? If not, do the percentages follow some other kind of pattern? One Quantitative Variable We have explored the distribution of a categorical variable using a bar chart supplemented by numerical measures (percent of observations in each category). In this section, we will learn how to display the distribution of a quantitative variable. To display data from one quantitative variable graphically, we typically use the histogram. Example5 Break the following range of values into intervals and count how many observations fall into each interval. Exam Grades Here are the exam grades of 15 students: 88, 48, 60, 51, 57, 85, 69, 75, 97, 72, 71, 79, 65, 63, 73 We first need to break the range of values into intervals (also called “bins” or “classes”). In this case, since our dataset consists of exam scores, it will make sense to choose intervals that typically correspond to the range of a letter grade, 10 points wide: 40-50, 50-60, … 90-100. By counting how many of the 15 observations fall in each of the intervals, we get the following table: SCORE COUNT [40,50) 1 [50,60) 2 [60,70) 4 [70,80) 5 [80,90) 2 [90,100) 1 To construct the histogram from this table we plot the intervals on the \\(X\\)-axis, and show the number of observations in each interval (frequency of the interval) on the \\(Y\\)-axis, which is represented by the height of a rectangle located above the interval: Interpreting the Histogram Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can describe the overall pattern of the distribution and mention any striking deviations from that pattern. More specifically, we should consider the following features of the distribution: Shape Center Spread Outliers We will get a sense of the overall pattern of the data from the histogram’s center, spread, and shape, while outliers will highlight deviations from that pattern. Shape When describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider: Symmetry/skewness of the distribution. Peakedness (modality)—the number of peaks (modes) the distribution has. We distinguish between: 8.1 Symmetric Distributions Note that all three distributions are symmetric, but are different in their modality (peakedness). The first distribution is unimodal—it has one mode (roughly at 10) around which the observations are concentrated. The second distribution is bimodal—it has two modes (roughly at 10 and 20) around which the observations are concentrated. The third distribution is kind of flat, or uniform. The distribution has no modes, or no value around which the observations are concentrated. Rather, we see that the observations are roughly uniformly distributed among the different values. 8.2 Skewed Right Distributions A distribution is called skewed right if, as in the histogram above, the right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left tail (small values). Note that in a skewed right distribution, the bulk of the observations are small/medium, with a few observations that are much larger than the rest. An example of a real-life variable that has a skewed right distribution is salary. Most people earn in the low/medium range of salaries, with a few exceptions (CEOs, professional athletes etc.) that are distributed along a large range (long “tail”) of higher values. 8.3 Skewed Left Distributions A distribution is called skewed left if, as in the histogram above, the left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail (larger values). Note that in a skewed left distribution, the bulk of the observations are medium/large, with a few observations that are much smaller than the rest. An example of a real life variable that has a skewed left distribution is age of death from natural causes (heart disease, cancer, etc.). Most such deaths happen at older ages, with fewer cases happening at younger ages. Recall our grades example: As you can see from the histogram, the grades distribution is roughly symmetric. Center The center of the distribution is its midpoint—the value that divides the distribution so that approximately half the observations take smaller values, and approximately half the observations take larger values. Note that from looking at the histogram we can get only a rough estimate for the center of the distribution. (More exact ways of finding measures of center will be discussed in the next section.) Recall our grades example (image above). As you can see from the histogram, the center of the grades distribution is roughly 70 (7 students scored below 70, and 8 students scored above 70). Spread The spread (also called variability) of the distribution can be described by the approximate range covered by the data. From looking at the histogram, we can approximate the smallest observation (minimum), and the largest observation (maximum), and thus approximate the range. In our example: exam &lt;- c(88, 48, 60, 51, 57, 85, 69, 75, 97, 72, 71, 79, 65, 63, 73) min(exam) [1] 48 max(exam) [1] 97 range(exam) [1] 48 97 Outliers Outliers are observations that fall outside the overall pattern. For example, the following histogram represents a distribution that has a high probable outlier: The overall pattern of the distribution of a quantitative variable is described by its shape, center, and spread. By inspecting the histogram, we can describe the shape of the distribution, but, as we saw, we can only get a rough estimate for the center and spread. A description of the distribution of a quantitative variable must include, in addition to the graphical display, a more precise numerical description of the center and spread of the distribution. The two main numerical measures for the center of a distribution are the mean and the median. Each one of these measures is based on a completely different idea of describing the center of a distribution. Mean The mean is the average of a set of observations (i.e., the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations). If the \\(n\\) observations are \\(x_1, x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\), their mean, which we denote \\(\\bar{x}\\) (and read x-bar), is therefore: \\[\\bar{x}=\\frac{x_1+ x_2+\\cdots+x_n}{n}\\]. World Cup Soccer The data frame SOCCER from the PASWR2 package contains how many goals were scored in the regulation 90 minute periods of World Cup soccer matches from 1990 to 2002. Total # of Goals Game Frequency 0 19 1 49 2 60 3 47 4 32 5 18 6 3 7 3 8 1 To find the mean number of goals scored per game, we would need to find the sum of all 232 numbers, then divide that sum by 232. Rather than add 232 numbers, we use the fact that the same numbers appear many times. For example, the number 0 appears 19 times, the number 1 appears 49 times, the number 2 appears 60 times, etc. If we add up 19 zeros, we get 0. If we add up 49 ones, we get 49. If we add up 60 twos, we get 120. Repeated addition is multiplication. Thus, the sum of the 232 numbers = 0(19) + 1(49) + 2(60) + 3(47) + 4(32) + 5(18) + 6(3) + 7(3) + 8(1) = 575. The mean is 575 / 232 = 2.478448. This way of calculating a mean is sometimes referred to as a weighted average, since each value is “weighted” by its frequency. library(PASWR2) FT &lt;- xtabs(~goals, data = SOCCER) FT goals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 19 49 60 47 32 18 3 3 1 pgoal &lt;- FT/575 pgoal goals 0 1 2 3 4 5 0.033043478 0.085217391 0.104347826 0.081739130 0.055652174 0.031304348 6 7 8 0.005217391 0.005217391 0.001739130 ngoals &lt;- as.numeric(names(FT)) ngoals [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 weighted.mean(x = ngoals, w = pgoal) [1] 2.478448 mean(SOCCER$goals, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 2.478448 Median The median (\\(M\\)) is the midpoint of the distribution. It is the number such that half of the observations fall above and half fall below. To find the median: Order the data from smallest to largest Consider whether \\(n\\), the number of observations, is even or odd. If \\(n\\) is odd, the median \\(M\\) is the center observation in the ordered list. This observation is the one “sitting” in the \\((n + 1)/2\\) spot in the ordered list If \\(n\\) is even,the median \\(M\\) is the mean of the two center observations in the ordered list. These two observations are the ones “sitting” in the \\(n/2\\) and \\((n/2) + 1\\) spots in the ordered list. For the SOCCER example, the median number of goals is the average of the values at the 232/2 = 116 ordered location (a two) and the 232/2 + 1 = 117 ordered location (also a two). The average of two 2s is a 2. Using the median function in R below verifies the answer. median(SOCCER$goals, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 2 Comparing the Mean and Median As we have seen, the mean and the median, the most common measures of center, each describe the center of a distribution of values in a different way. The mean describes the center as an average value, in which the actual values of the data points play an important role. The median, on the other hand, locates the middle value as the center, and the order of the data is the key to finding it. To get a deeper understanding of the differences between these two measures of center, consider the following example. Here are two datasets: Data set A \\(\\rightarrow\\) (64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71, 73) Data set B \\(\\rightarrow\\) (64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71, 730) DataA &lt;- c(64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71, 73) DataB &lt;- c(64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71, 730) meanA &lt;- mean(DataA) meanB &lt;- mean(DataB) medianA &lt;- median(DataA) medianB &lt;- median(DataB) c(meanA, meanB, medianA, medianB) [1] 68.14286 162.00000 68.00000 68.00000 For dataset A, the mean is 68.1428571, and the median is 68. Looking at dataset B, notice that all of the observations except the last one are close together. The observation 730 is very large, and is certainly an outlier. In this case, the median is still 68, but the mean will be influenced by the high outlier, and shifted up to 162. The message that we should take from this example is: The mean is very sensitive to outliers (because it factors in their magnitude), while the median is resistant to outliers. Therefore: For symmetric distributions with no outliers: \\(\\bar{x}\\) is approximately equal to \\(M\\). In the distribution above, the mean is 9.9965127 and the median is 9.9925812. For skewed right distributions and/or data sets with high outliers: \\(\\bar{x} &gt; M\\) In the distribution above, the mean is 0.1998402 and the median is 0.168208. For skewed left distributions and/or data sets with high outliers: \\(\\bar{x} &lt; M\\) In the distribution above, the mean is 1.8001598 and the median is 1.831792. We will therefore use \\(\\bar{x}\\) as a measure of center for symmetric distributions with no outliers. Otherwise, the median will be a more appropriate measure of the center of our data. Measures of Spread So far we have learned about different ways to quantify the center of a distribution. A measure of center by itself is not enough, though, to describe a distribution. Consider the following two distributions of exam scores. Both distributions are centered around 70 (the mean and median of both distributions is approximately 70), but the distributions are quite different. The first distribution has a much larger variability in scores compared to the second one. In order to describe the distribution, we therefore need to supplement the graphical display not only with a measure of center, but also with a measure of the variability (or spread) of the distribution. Range The range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of variability. The range is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (Min) and the largest one (Max). Range = Max - Min Standard Deviation The idea behind the standard deviation is to quantify the spread of a distribution by measuring how far the observations are from their mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\). The standard deviation gives the average (or typical distance) between a data point and the mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\). Notation There are many notations for the standard deviation: SD, s, Sd, StDev. Here, we’ll use SD as an abbreviation for standard deviation and use s as the symbol. Calculation In order to get a better understanding of the standard deviation, it would be useful to see an example of how it is calculated. In practice, we will use statistical software to do the calculation. Video Store Calculations The following are the number of customers who entered a video store in 8 consecutive hours: 7, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 15, 9 To find the standard deviation of the number of hourly customers: Find the mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\) of your data: \\(7 + 9 + 5 + ... + 98 = 9\\) Find the deviations from the mean: the difference between each observation and the mean \\((7 - 9), (9 - 9), (5 - 9), (13 - 9), (3 - 9), (11 - 9), (15 - 9), (9 - 9)\\) These numbers are \\(-2, 0, -4, 4, -6, 2, 6, 0\\) Since the standard deviation is the average (typical) distance between the data points and their mean, it would make sense to average the deviations we got. Note, however, that the sum of the deviations from the mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\), is 0 (add them up and see for yourself). This is always the case, and is the reason why we have to do a more complicated calculation to determine the standard deviation Square each of the deviations: The first few are: \\((-2)^2 = 4, (0)^2 = 0, (-4)^2 = 16\\), and the rest are \\(16, 36, 4, 36, 0\\) Average the square deviations by adding them up and dividing by \\(n - 1\\) (one less than the sample size): \\(4+0+16+16+36+4+36+0(8−1)=1127=16\\) The reason why we “sort of” average the square deviations (divide by \\(n −1\\) ) rather than take the actual average (divide by $$) is beyond the scope of the course at this point, but will be addressed later. This average of the squared deviations is called the variance of the data. The SD of the data is the square root of the variance: SD \\(= \\sqrt{16} = 4\\) Why do we take the square root? Note that 16 is an average of the squared deviations, and therefore has different units of measurement. In this case 16 is measured in “squared customers”, which obviously cannot be interpreted. We therefore take the square root in order to compensate for the fact that we squared our deviations and in order to go back to the original unit of measurement. Recall that the average number of customers who enter the store in an hour is 9. The interpretation of SD = 4 is that, on average, the actual number of customers that enter the store each hour is 4 away from 9. x &lt;- c(7, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 15, 9) n &lt;- length(x) xbar &lt;- mean(x) xbar [1] 9 dev &lt;- x - xbar dev [1] -2 0 -4 4 -6 2 6 0 dev2 &lt;- dev^2 dev2 [1] 4 0 16 16 36 4 36 0 cbind(x, dev, dev2) x dev dev2 [1,] 7 -2 4 [2,] 9 0 0 [3,] 5 -4 16 [4,] 13 4 16 [5,] 3 -6 36 [6,] 11 2 4 [7,] 15 6 36 [8,] 9 0 0 VAR &lt;- sum(dev2)/(n - 1) VAR [1] 16 SD &lt;- sqrt(VAR) SD [1] 4 # Or using functions var() and sd() var(x) [1] 16 sd(x) [1] 4 Univariate Graphing Lab There are a variety of conventional ways to visualize data-tables, histograms, bar graphs, etc. Now that your data have been managed, it is time to graph your variables one at a time and examine both center and spread.

In this section, examining relationships, we will look at two variables at a time and, as the title suggests, explore the relationship between them using (as before) visual displays and numerical summaries. While it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies (including yours) pose research questions that involve exploring the relationship between two variables. Here are a few examples of such research questions with the two variables highlighted: Examples: Is there a relationship between gender and test scores on a particular standardized test? Other ways of phrasing the same research question: Is performance on the test related to gender? Is there a gender effect on test scores? Are there differences in test scores between males and females? Is there a relationship between the type of light a baby sleeps with (no light, night-light, lamp) and whether the child develops nearsightedness? Are the smoking habits of a person (yes, no) related to the person’s gender? How well can we predict a student’s freshman year GPA from his/her SAT score? In most analyses involving two variables, each of the variables has a role. We distinguish between: the response variable (also known as the dependent variable (DV), or outcome) the explanatory variable (also known as the independent variable (IV), or the predictor) At this point, we will be asking you to “impose” a causal model on your research question, despite the fact that you will not be able to directly evaluate a causal relationship. This video defines the two types of variables you will be identifying and shows you how this decision will guide the kinds of graphing you do and the kind of statistical tests that you will ultimately use.

["chapter-9.html", "Chapter 10 Chapter", " Chapter 10 Chapter Hypothesis Testing Please watch the Chapter 10 video. Thus far, we have focused on descriptive statistics. Through our examination of frequency distributions, graphical representations of our variables, and calculations of center and spread, the goal has been to describe and summarize data. Now you will be introduced to inferential statistics. In addition to describing data, inferential statistics allow us to directly test our hypothesis by evaluating (based on a sample) our research question with the goal of generalizing the results to the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Hypothesis testing is one of the most important inferential tools of application of statistics to real life problems. It is used when we need to make decisions concerning populations on the basis of only sample information. A variety of statistical tests are used to arrive at these decisions (e.g. Analysis of Variance, Chi-Square Test of Independence, etc.). Steps involved in hypothesis testing include specifying the null (\\(H_0\\)) and alternate (\\(H_a\\) or \\(H_1\\)) hypotheses; choosing a sample; assessing the evidence; and making conclusions. Statistical hypothesis testing is defined as assessing evi- dence provided by the data in favor of or against each hypothesis about the population. The purpose of this section is to build your understanding about how statistical hypothesis testing works. Example: To test what I have read in the scientific literature, I decide to evaluate whether or not there is a difference in smoking quantity (i.e. number of cigarettes smoked) according to whether or not an individual has a diagnosis of major depression. Let’s analyze this example using the 4 steps: Specifying the null (\\(H_0\\)) and alternate (\\(H_a\\)) hypotheses; choosing a sample; assessing the evidence; and making conclusions. There are two opposing hypotheses for this question: There is no difference in smoking quantity between people with and without depression. There is a difference in smoking quantity between people with and without depression. The first hypothesis (aka null hypothesis) basically says nothing special is going on between smoking and depression. In other words, that they are unrelated to one another. The second hypothesis (aka the alternate hypothesis) says that there is a relationship and allows that the difference in smoking between those individuals with and without depression could be in either direction (i.e. individuals with depression may smoke more than individuals without depression or they may smoke less). 1. Choosing a Sample: I chose the NESARC, a representative sample of 43,093 non-institutionalized adults in the U.S. As I am interested in evaluating these hypotheses only among individuals who are smokers and who are younger (rather than older) adults, I subset the NESARC data to individuals that are 1) current daily smokers (i.e. smoked in the past year CHECK321 ==1, smoked over 100 cigarettes S3AQ1A ==1, typically smoked every day S3AQ3B1 == 1) are 2) between the ages 18 and 25. This sample (\\(n=1320\\)) showed the following: # See Chapter 7 for the creation of nesarc summary(nesarc) Ethnicity Age MajorDepression Caucasian :849 Min. :18.00 No Depression :965 African American:170 1st Qu.:20.00 Yes Depression:355 Native American : 30 Median :22.00 Asian : 47 Mean :21.61 Hispanic :224 3rd Qu.:24.00 Max. :25.00 TobaccoDependence DailyCigsSmoked Sex No Nicotine Dependence:521 Min. : 1.00 Female:646 Nicotine Dependence :799 1st Qu.: 7.00 Male :674 Median :10.00 Mean :13.36 3rd Qu.:20.00 Max. :98.00 NA&#39;s :5 AlcoholAD NumberNicotineSymptoms DCScat No Alcohol :768 Min. : 0.00 (0,5] :249 Alcohol Abuse :242 1st Qu.: 9.00 (5,10] :477 Alcohol Dependence : 62 Median :17.00 (10,15]:134 Alcohol Abuse and Dependence:248 Mean :19.61 (15,20]:368 3rd Qu.:29.25 (20,98]: 87 Max. :65.00 NA&#39;s : 5 tapply(nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked, list(nesarc$MajorDepression), mean, na.rm = TRUE) No Depression Yes Depression 13.16632 13.90368 tapply(nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked, list(nesarc$MajorDepression), sd, na.rm = TRUE) No Depression Yes Depression 8.460312 9.162474 Young adult, daily smokers with depression smoked an average of 13.9 cigarettes per day (SD = 9.2). Young adult, daily smokers without depression smoked an average of 13.2 cigarettes per day (SD = 8.5). While it is true that 13.9 cigarettes per day are more than 13.2 cigarettes per day, it is not at all clear that this is a large enough difference to reject the null hypothesis. 2. Assessing the Evidence: In order to assess whether the data provide strong enough evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e. against the claim that there is no relationship between smoking and depression), we need to ask ourselves: How surprising is it to get a difference of 0.7373626 cigarettes smoked per day between our two groups (depression vs. no depression) assuming that the null hypothesis is true (i.e. there is no relationship between smoking and depression). This is the step where we calculate how likely it is to get data like that observed when \\(H_0\\) is true. In a sense, this is the heart of the process, since we draw our conclusions based on this probability. It turns out that the probability that we’ll get a difference of this size in the mean number of cigarettes smoked in a random sample of 1320 participants is 0.1711689 (do not worry about how this was calculated at this point). t.test(nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked ~ nesarc$MajorDepression, var.equal = TRUE) Two Sample t-test data: nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked by nesarc$MajorDepression t = -1.3692, df = 1313, p-value = 0.1712 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -1.7938413 0.3191162 sample estimates: mean in group No Depression mean in group Yes Depression 13.16632 13.90368 pvalue &lt;- t.test(nesarc$DailyCigsSmoked ~ nesarc$MajorDepression, var.equal = TRUE)$p.value pvalue [1] 0.1711689 # Or summary(aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ MajorDepression, data = nesarc)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) MajorDepression 1 140 140.41 1.875 0.171 Residuals 1313 98336 74.89 5 observations deleted due to missingness Well, we found that if the null hypothesis were true (i.e. there is no association) there is a probability of 0.1711689 of observing data like that observed. Now you have to decide… Do you think that a probability of 0.1711689 makes our data rare enough (surprising enough) under the null hypothesis so that the fact that we did observe it is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis? Or do you feel that a probability of 0.1711689 means that data like we observed are not very likely when the null hypothesis is true (not unlikely enough to conclude that getting such data is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis). Basically, this is your decision. However, it would be nice to have some kind of guideline about what is generally considered surprising enough. The reason for using an inferential test is to get a p-value. The p-value determines whether or not we reject the null hypothesis. The p-value provides an estimate of how often we would get the obtained result by chance if in fact the null hypothesis were true. In statistics, a result is called statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. If the p-value is small (i.e. less than 0.05), this suggests that it is likely (more than 95% likely) that the association of interest would be present following repeated samples drawn from the population (aka a sampling distribution). If this probability is very small, then that means that it would be very surprising to get data like that observed if the null hypothesis were true. The fact that we did not observe such data is therefore evidence supporting the null hypothesis, and we should accept it. On the other hand, if this probability were very small, this means that observing data like that observed is surprising if the null hypothesis were true, so the fact that we observed such data provides evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e. suggests that there is an association between smoking and depression). This crucial probability, therefore, has a special name. It is called the p-value of the test. In our examples, the p-value was given to you (and you were reassured that you didn’t need to worry about how these were derived): P-Value = 0.1711689 Obviously, the smaller the p-value, the more surprising it is to get data like ours when the null hypothesis is true, and therefore the stronger the evidence the data provide against the null. Looking at the p-value in our example we see that there is not adequate evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between smoking and depression. Since our conclusion is based on how small the p-value is, or in other words, how surprising our data are when the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is true, it would be nice to have some kind of guideline or cutoff that will help determine how small the p-value must be, or how “rare” (unlikely) our data must be when \\(H_0\\) is true, for us to conclude that we have enough evidence to reject \\(H_0\\). This cutoff exists, and because it is so important, it has a special name. It is called the significance level of the test and is usually denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\alpha\\). The most commonly used significance level is \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) (or 5%). This means that: if the p-value \\(&lt; \\alpha\\) (usually 0.05), then the data we got is considered to be “rare (or surprising) enough” when \\(H_0\\) is true, and we say that the data provide significant evidence against \\(H_0\\), so we reject \\(H_0\\) and accept \\(H_a\\). if the p-value \\(&gt; \\alpha\\) (usually 0.05), then our data are not considered to be “surprising enough” when \\(H_0\\) is true, and we say that our data do not provide enough evidence to reject \\(H_0\\) (or, equivalently, that the data do not provide enough evidence to accept \\(H_a\\)). Although you will always be interpreting the p-value for a statistical test, the specific statistical test that you will use to evaluate your hypotheses depends on the type of explanatory and response variables that you have. Bivariate Statistical Tools: \\(C \\rightarrow Q\\) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) \\(C \\rightarrow C\\) Chi-Square Test of Independence (\\(\\chi^2\\)) \\(Q \\rightarrow Q\\) Correlation Coefficient (r) \\(Q \\rightarrow C\\) Logistic regression The Big Idea Behind Inference A sampling distribution is a distribution of all possible samples (of a given size) that could be drawn from the population. If you have a sampling distribution meant to estimate a mean (e.g. the average number of cigarettes smoked in a population), this would be represented as a distribution of frequencies of mean number of cigarettes for consecutive samples drawn from the population. Although we ultimately rely on only one sample, if that sample is representative of the larger population, inferential statistical tests allow us to estimate (with different levels of certainty) a mean (or other parameter such as a standard deviation, proportion, etc.) for the entire population. This idea is the foundation for each of the inferential tools that you will be using this semester. "],

In our description of hypothesis testing in the previous chapter, we started with case \\(C \\rightarrow Q\\), where the explanatory variable/independent variable/predictor (\\(X\\) = major depression) is categorical and the response variable/dependent variable/outcome (\\(Y\\) = number of cigarettes smoked) is quantitative. Here is a similar example: GPA and Year in College Say that our variable of interest is the GPA of college students in the United States. Since GPA is quantitative, we do inference on \\(\\mu\\), the (population) mean GPA among all U.S. college students. We are really interested in the relationship between GPA and college year: \\(X\\): year in college (1 = freshmen, 2 = sophomore, 3 = junior, 4 = senior) and \\(Y\\): GPA In other words, we want to explore whether GPA is related to year in college. The way to think about this is that the population of U.S. college students is now broken into 4 sub-populations: freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Within each of these four groups, we are interested in the GPA. The inference must therefore involve the 4 sub-population means: \\(\\mu_1\\): mean GPA among freshmen in the United States \\(\\mu_2\\): mean GPA among sophomores in the United States \\(\\mu_3\\): mean GPA among juniors in the United States \\(\\mu_4\\): mean GPA among seniors in the United States It makes sense that the inference about the relationship between year and GPA has to be based on some kind of comparison of these four means. If we infer that these four means are not all equal (i.e., that there are some differences in GPA across years in college) then that’s equivalent to saying GPA is related to year in college. Let’s summarize this example with a figure: In general, then, making inferences about the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in Case \\(C\\rightarrow Q\\) boils down to comparing the means of \\(Y\\) in the sub-populations, which are created by the categories defined in \\(X\\) (say \\(k\\) categories). The following figure summarizes this: The inferential method for comparing means is called Analysis of Variance (abbreviated as ANOVA), and the test associated with this method is called the ANOVA F-test. We will first present our leading example, and then introduce the ANOVA F-test by going through its 4 steps, illustrating each one using the example. Is “academic frustration” related to major? A college dean believes that students with different majors may experience different levels of academic frustration. Random samples of size 35 of Business, English, Mathematics, and Psychology majors are asked to rate their level of academic frustration on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 20 (highest). The figure highlights that examining the relationship between major (\\(X\\)) and frustration level (\\(Y\\)) amounts to comparing the mean frustration levels (\\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\mu_3,\\mu_4\\)) among the four majors defined by \\(X\\). 11.1 The ANOVA F-Test Now that we understand in what kind of situations ANOVA is used, we are ready to learn how it works. Stating the Hypotheses The null hypothesis claims that there is no relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Since the relationship is examined by comparing \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\ldots,\\mu_k\\) (the means of \\(Y\\) in the populations defined by the values of \\(X\\)), no relationship would mean that all the means are equal. Therefore the null hypothesis of the F-testis: \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\cdots = \\mu_k\\). As we mentioned earlier, here we have just one alternative hypothesis, which claims that there is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). In terms of the means \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\ldots,\\mu_k\\) it simply says the opposite of the alternative, that not all the means are equal, and we simply write: \\(H_a:\\) not all the \\(\\mu\\)’s are equal. Recall our “Is academic frustration related to major?” example: Review: True or False The hypothesis that are being test in our example are: \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\mu_4\\) \\(H_1: \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\) The correct hypotheses for our example are: \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\mu_4\\) \\(H_1: \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j\\) for some \\(i,j\\) Note that there are many ways for \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\mu_3,\\mu_4\\) not to be all equal, and \\(\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\) is just one of them. Another way could be \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\) or \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\). The alternative of the ANOVA F-test simply states that not all of the means are equal and is not specific about the way in which they are different. 11.2 The Idea Behind the ANOVA F-Test Let’s think about how we would go about testing whether the population means \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\mu_3,\\mu_4\\) are equal. It seems as if the best we could do is to calculate their point estimates—the sample mean in each of our 4 samples (denote them by \\(\\bar{x}_1,\\bar{x}_2,\\bar{x}_3,\\bar{x}_4)\\), and see how far apart these sample means are, or, in other words, measure the variation between the sample means. If we find that the four sample means are not all close together, we’ll say that we have evidence against \\(H_0\\), and otherwise, if they are close together, we’ll say that we do not have evidence against \\(H_0\\). This seems quite simple, but is this enough? Let’s see. It turns out that: library(PDS) MEANS &lt;- with(data = frustration, tapply(Frustration.Score, Major, mean) ) MEANS Business English Mathematics Psychology 7.314286 11.771429 13.200000 14.028571 summary(aov(Frustration.Score ~ Major, data = frustration)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Major 3 939.9 313.28 46.6 &lt;2e-16 *** Residuals 136 914.3 6.72 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The sample mean frustration score of the 35 business majors is: \\(\\bar{x}_1 = 7.3142857\\) The sample mean frustration score of the 35 English majors is: \\(\\bar{x}_2 = 11.7714286\\) The sample mean frustration score of the 35 mathematics majors is: \\(\\bar{x}_3 = 13.2\\) The sample mean frustration score of the 35 psychology majors is: \\(\\bar{x}_4 = 14.0285714\\) We present two possible scenarios for our example (different data). In both cases, we construct side-by-side box plots (showing the distribution of the data including the range, lowest and highest values, the mean, etc.) four groups of frustration levels that have the same variation among their means. Thus, Scenario #1 and Scenario #2 (the actual values from frustration) both show data for four groups with the sample means 7.3142857, 11.7714286, 13.2, and 14.0285714. Review 11.2 Multiple Choice Look carefully at the graphs of both scenarios. For which of the two scenarios would you be willing to believe that samples have been taken from four groups which have the same population means? A. Scenario 1 B. Scenario 2 The important difference between the two scenarios is that the first represents data with a large amount of variation within each of the four groups; the second represents data with a small amount of variation within each of the four groups. Scenario 1, because of the large amount of spread within the groups, shows box plots with plenty of overlap. One could imagine the data arising from 4 random samples taken from 4 populations, all having the same mean of about 11 or 12. The first group of values may have been a bit on the low side, and the other three a bit on the high side, but such differences could conceivably have come about by chance. This would be the case if the null hypothesis, claiming equal population means, were true. Scenario 2, because of the small amount of spread within the groups, shows boxplots with very little overlap. It would be very hard to believe that we are sampling from four groups that have equal population means. This would be the case if the null hypothesis, claiming equal population means, were false. Thus, in the language of hypothesis tests, we would say that if the data were configured as they are in scenario 1, we would not reject the null hypothesis that population mean frustration levels were equal for the four majors. If the data were configured as they are in scenario 2, we would reject the null hypothesis, and we would conclude that mean frustration levels differ depending on major. Let’s summarize what we learned from this. The question we need to answer is: Are the differences among the sample means (\\(\\bar{x}\\)’s) due to true differences among the \\(\\mu\\)’s (alternative hypothesis), or merely due to sampling variability (null hypothesis)? In order to answer this question using our data, we obviously need to look at the variation among the sample means, but this alone is not enough. We need to look at the variation among the sample means relative to the variation within the groups. In other words, we need to look at the quantity: \\[\\frac{\\text{VARIATION AMONG SAMPLE MEANS}}{\\text{VARIATION WITHIN GROUPS}}\\] which measures to what extent the difference among the sampled groups’ means dominates over the usual variation within sampled groups (which reflects differences in individuals that are typical in random samples). When the variation within groups is large (like in scenario 1), the variation (differences) among the sample means could become negligible and the data provide very little evidence against \\(H_0\\). When the variation within groups is small (like in scenario 2), the variation among the sample means dominates over it, and the data have stronger evidence against \\(H_0\\). Looking at this ratio of variations is the idea behind the comparison of means; hence the name analysis of variance (ANOVA). Did I Get This? Consider the following generic situation: where we’re testing: \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3\\) versus \\(H_a:\\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j\\) for some \\(i,j\\) or not all \\(\\mu\\)’s are equal. The following are two possible scenarios of the data (note in both scenarios the sample means are 24.9386037, 30.0584293, and 35.285865). Consider the frustration Data Frame Again ggplot(data = frustration, aes(x = Major, y = Frustration.Score)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + labs(y = &quot;Frustration Score&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, title = &quot;Frustration Score by Major&quot;) RES &lt;- summary(aov(Frustration.Score ~ Major, data = frustration)) RES Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) Major 3 939.9 313.28 46.6 &lt;2e-16 *** Residuals 136 914.3 6.72 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Note that the F-statistic is 46.6008958, which is very large, indicating that the data provide evidence against \\(H_0\\) (we can also see that the p-value is so small (\\(8.8415737\\times 10^{-21}\\)) that it is essentially 0, which supports that conclusion as well). 11.3 Finding the P-Value The p-value of the ANOVA F-test is the probability of getting an F statistic as large as we got (or even larger) had \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\cdots = \\mu_k\\) been true. In other words, it tells us how surprising it is to find data like those observed, assuming that there is no difference among the population means \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\ldots, \\mu_k\\). As we already noticed before, the p-value in our example is so small that it is essentially 0, telling us that it would be next to impossible to get data like those observed had the mean frustration level of the four majors been the same (as the null hypothesis claims). 11.4 Making Conclusions in Context As usual, we base our conclusion on the p-value. A small p-value tells us that our data contain evidence against \\(H_0\\). More specifically, a small p-value tells us that the differences between the sample means are statistically significant (unlikely to have happened by chance), and therefore we reject \\(H_0\\). If the p-value is not small, the data do not provide enough evidence to reject \\(H_0\\), and so we continue to believe that it may be true. A significance level (cut-off probability) of 0.05 can help determine what is considered a small p-value. In our example, the p-value is extremely small (close to 0) indicating that our data provide extremely strong evidence to reject \\(H_0\\). We conclude that the frustration level means of the four majors are not all the same, or, in other words, that majors do have an effect on students’ academic frustration levels at the school where the test was conducted. 11.5 Post Hoc Tests When testing the relationship between your explanatory (\\(X\\)) and response variable (\\(Y\\)) in the context of ANOVA, your categorical explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) may have more than two levels. For example, when we examine the differences in mean GPA (\\(Y\\)) across different college years (\\(X\\) = freshman, sophomore, junior and senior) or the differences in mean frustration level (\\(Y\\)) by college major (\\(X\\) = Business, English, Mathematics, Psychology), there is just one alternative hypothesis, which claims that there is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). When the null hypothesis is rejected, the conclusion is that not all the means are equal. Note that there are many ways for \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3, \\mu_4\\) not to be all equal, and \\(\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\) is just one of them. Another way could be \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\) or \\(\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\neq \\mu_3 \\neq \\mu_4\\) In the case where the explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) represents more than two groups, a significant ANOVA F test does not tell us which groups are different from the others. To determine which groups are different from the others, we would need to perform post hoc tests. These tests, done after the ANOVA, are generally termed post hoc paired comparisons. Post hoc paired comparisons (meaning “after the fact” or “afterdata collection”) must be conducted in a particular way in order to prevent excessive Type I error. Type I error occurs when you make an incorrect decision about the null hypothesis. Specifically, this type of error is made when your p-value makes you reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) when it is true. In other words, your p-value is sufficiently small for you to say that there is a real association, despite the fact that the differences you see are due to chance alone. The type I error rate equals your p-value and is denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha). Although a Type I Error rate of 0.05 is considered acceptable (i.e. it is acceptable that 5 times out of 100 you will reject the null hypothesis when it is true), higher Type I error rates are not considered acceptable. If you were to use the significance level of 0.05 across multiple paired comparisons (for example, three independent comparisons) with \\(\\alpha = 0 .05\\), then the \\(\\alpha\\) rate across all three comparisons is \\(1 - (1 - \\alpha)^{\\text{Number of comparisons}} = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 = 0.142625\\). In other words, across the unprotected paired comparisons you will reject the null hypothesis when it is true roughly 14 times out of 100. The purpose of running protected post hoc tests is that they allow you to conduct multiple paired comparisons without inflating the Type I Error rate. For ANOVA, you can use one of several post hoc tests, each which control for Type I Error, while performing paired comparisons (Duncan Multiple Range test, Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison test, Newman-Keuls test, Scheffe’s test, Tukey’s HSD test, Fisher’s LSD test, Sidak). Analysis of Variance Analysis of variance assesses whether the means of two or more groups are statistically different from each other. This analysis is appropriate when you want to compare the means (quantitative variables) of \\(k\\) groups (categorical variables) under certain assumptions (constant variance for all \\(k\\) groups). The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the mean of the quantitative variable across groups (categorical variable), while the alternative is that there is a difference.

Analysis of Variance Assignment Post the syntax to your private GitHub repository used to run an ANOVA along with corresponding output and a few sentences of interpretation. You will need to analyze and interpret post hoc paired comparisons in instances where your original statistical test was significant, and you were examining more than two groups (i.e. more than two levels of a categorical, explanatory variable).

The last statistical test that we studied (ANOVA) involved the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) and a quantitative response variable (\\(Y\\)). Next, we will consider inferences about the relationships between two categorical variables, corresponding to case \\(C \\rightarrow C\\). In our graphing, we have already summarized the relationship between two categorical variables for a given data set, without trying to generalize beyond the sample data. Now we will perform statistical inference for two categorical variables, using the sample data to draw conclusions about whether or not we have evidence that the variables are related in the larger population from which the sample was drawn. In other words, we would like to assess whether the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) that we observed in the data is due to a real relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the population, or if it is something that could have happened just by chance due to sampling variability. The statistical test that will answer this question is called the chi-square test of independence. Chi is a Greek letter that looks like this: \\(\\chi\\), so the test is sometimes referred to as: The \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence. Let’s start with an example. In the early 1970s, a young man challenged an Oklahoma state law that prohibited the sale of 3.2% beer to males under age 21 but allowed its sale to females in the same age group. The case (Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 [1976]) was ultimately heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The main justification provided by Oklahoma for the law was traffic safety. One of the 3 main pieces of data presented to the Court was the result of a “random roadside survey” that recorded information on gender and whether or not the driver had been drinking alcohol in the previous two hours. There were a total of 619 drivers under 20 years of age included in the survey. The following two-way table summarizes the observed counts in the roadside survey: Table showing drinking status during the last two hours and gender No Yes Sum Female 122.00 16.00 138.00 Male 404.00 77.00 481.00 Sum 526.00 93.00 619.00 The following code shows how to read the data into a matrix, then convert the matrix to a table, then to a data frame named DF. MAT &lt;- matrix(data = c(77, 16, 404, 122), nrow = 2) dimnames(MAT) &lt;- list(Gender = c(&quot;Male&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;), DroveDrunk = c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;)) library(vcdExtra) TMAT &lt;- as.table(MAT) DFTMAT &lt;- as.data.frame(TMAT) # convert to data frame DF &lt;- vcdExtra::expand.dft(DFTMAT) xtabs(~Gender + DroveDrunk, data = DF) DroveDrunk Gender No Yes Female 122 16 Male 404 77 addmargins(xtabs(~Gender + DroveDrunk, data = DF)) DroveDrunk Gender No Yes Sum Female 122 16 138 Male 404 77 481 Sum 526 93 619 Our task is to assess whether these results provide evidence of a significant (“real”) relationship between gender and drunk driving. The following figure summarizes this example: Note that as the figure stresses, since we are looking to see whether drunk driving is related to gender, our explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) is gender, and the response variable (\\(Y\\)) is drunk driving. Both variables are two-valued categorical variables, and therefore our two-way table of observed counts is 2-by-2. It should be mentioned that the chi-square procedure that we are going to introduce here is not limited to 2-by-2 situations, but can be applied to any r-by-c situation where r is the number of rows (corresponding to the number of values of one of the variables) and c is the number of columns (corresponding to the number of values of the other variable). Before we introduce the chi-square test, let’s conduct an exploratory data analysis (that is, look at the data to get an initial feel for it). By doing that, we will also get a better conceptual understanding of the role of the test. 12.1 Exploratory Analysis Recall that the key to reporting appropriate summaries for a two-way table is deciding which of the two categorical variables plays the role of explanatory variable, and then calculating the conditional percentages — the percentages of the response variable for each value of the explanatory variable — separately. In this case, since the explanatory variable is gender, we would calculate the percentages of drivers who did (and did not) drink alcohol for males and females separately. Here is the table of conditional percentages: TA &lt;- xtabs(~ Gender + DroveDrunk, data = DF) prop.table(TA, 1) DroveDrunk Gender No Yes Female 0.8840580 0.1159420 Male 0.8399168 0.1600832 For the 619 sampled drivers, a larger percentage of males were found to be drunk than females (16.0% vs. 11.6%). Our data, in other words, provide some evidence that drunk driving is related to gender; however, this in itself is not enough to conclude that such a relationship exists in the larger population of drivers under 20. We need to further investigate the data and decide between the following two points of view: The evidence provided by the roadside survey (16% vs 11.6%) is strong enough to conclude (beyond a reasonable doubt) that it must be due to a relationship between drunk driving and gender in the population of drivers under 20. The evidence provided by the roadside survey (16% vs. 11.6%) is not strong enough to make that conclusion, and could have happened just by chance, due to sampling variability, and not necessarily because a relationship exists in the population. Actually, these two opposing points of view constitute the null and alternative hypotheses of the chi-square test for independence, so now that we understand our example and what we still need to find out, let’s introduce the four-step process of this test. 12.2 The Chi-Square Test for Independence The chi-square test for independence examines our observed data and tells us whether we have enough evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that two categorical variables are related. Much like the previous part on the ANOVA F-test, we are going to introduce the hypotheses (step 1), and then discuss the idea behind the test, which will naturally lead to the test statistic (step 2). Let’s start. Step 1: Stating the hypotheses Unlike all the previous tests that we presented, the null and alternative hypotheses in the chi-square test are stated in words rather than in terms of population parameters. They are: \\(H_0:\\) There is no relationship between the two categorical variables. (They are independent.) \\(H_a:\\) There is a relationship between the two categorical variables. (They are not independent.) EXAMPLE In our example, the null and alternative hypotheses would then state: \\(H_0:\\) There is no relationship between gender and drunk driving. \\(H_a:\\) There is a relationship between gender and drunk driving. Or equivalently, \\(H_0:\\) Drunk driving and gender are independent \\(H_a:\\) Drunk driving and gender are not independent and hence the name “chi-square test for independence.” 12.3 The Idea of the Chi-Square Test The idea behind the chi-square test, much like previous tests that we’ve introduced, is to measure how far the data are from what is claimed in the null hypothesis. The further the data are from the null hypothesis, the more evidence the data presents against it. We’ll use our data to develop this idea. Our data are represented by the observed counts: TA DroveDrunk Gender No Yes Female 122 16 Male 404 77 How will we represent the null hypothesis? In the previous tests we introduced, the null hypothesis was represented by the null value. Here there is not really a null value, but rather a claim that the two categorical variables (drunk driving and gender, in this case) are independent. To represent the null hypothesis, we will calculate another set of counts — the counts that we would expect to see (instead of the observed ones) if drunk driving and gender were really independent (i.e., if \\(H_0\\) were true). For example, we actually observed 77 males who drove drunk; if drunk driving and gender were indeed independent (if \\(H_0\\) were true), how many male drunk drivers would we expect to see instead of 77? Similarly, we can ask the same kind of question about (and calculate) the other three cells in our table. In other words, we will have two sets of counts: the observed counts (the data) the expected counts (if \\(H_0\\) were true) We will measure how far the observed counts are from the expected ones. Ultimately, we will base our decision on the size of the discrepancy between what we observed and what we would expect to observe if \\(H_0\\) were true. How are the expected counts calculated? Once again, we are in need of probability results. Recall from the probability section that if events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, then \\(P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\\). We use this rule for calculating expected counts, one cell at a time. Here again are the observed counts: TA DroveDrunk Gender No Yes Female 122 16 Male 404 77 If driving drunk and gender were independent then: \\[P(\\text{drunk and male}) = P(\\text{drunk}) \\times P(\\text{male})\\] By dividing the counts in our table, we see that: \\(P(\\text{Drunk}) = 93/619\\) and \\(P(\\text{Male}) = 481/619\\), and so, \\(P(\\text{Drunk and Male}) = (93 / 619) (481 / 619)\\) Therefore, since there are total of 619 drivers, if drunk driving and gender were independent, the count of drunk male drivers that I would expect to see is: \\(619\\times P(\\text{Drunk and Male})=619(93/619)(481/619)=93\\times 481/619 = 72.266559\\) Notice that this expression is the product of the column and row totals for that particular cell, divided by the overall table total: chisq.test(TA)$expected DroveDrunk Gender No Yes Female 117.2666 20.73344 Male 408.7334 72.26656 This will always be the case, and will help streamline our calculations: \\[\\text{Expected Count} = \\frac{\\text{Column Total} \\times \\text{Row Total} }{\\text{Table Total}}\\] Step 3: Finding the p-value The p-value for the chi-square test for independence is the probability of getting counts like those observed, assuming that the two variables are not related (which is what is claimed by the null hypothesis). The smaller the p-value, the more surprising it would be to get counts like we did, if the null hypothesis were true. Technically, the p-value is the probability of observing \\(\\chi^2\\) at least as large as the one observed. Using statistical software, we find that the p-value for this test is 0.2007975. chisq.test(TA, correct = FALSE) Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: TA X-squared = 1.6366, df = 1, p-value = 0.2008 Step 4: Stating the conclusion in context As usual, we use the magnitude of the p-value to draw our conclusions. A small p-value indicates that the evidence provided by the data is strong enough to reject Ho and conclude (beyond a reasonable doubt) that the two variables are related. In particular, if a significance level of .05 is used, we will reject Ho if the p-value is less than .05. Example A p-value of 0.2007975 is not small at all. There is no compelling statistical evidence to reject Ho, and so we will continue to assume it may be true. Gender and drunk driving may be independent, and so the data suggest that a law that forbids sale of 3.2% beer to males and permits it to females is unwarranted. In fact, the Supreme Court, by a 7-2 majority, struck down the Oklahoma law as discriminatory and unjustified. In the majority opinion Justice Brennan wrote (http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/craig.html): “Clearly, the protection of public health and safety represents an important function of state and local governments. However, appellees’ statistics in our view cannot support the conclusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective and therefore the distinction cannot under [prior case law] withstand equal protection challenge.” 12.4 Post Hoc Tests For post hoc tests following a Chi-Square, we use what is referred to as the Bonferroni Adjustment. Like the post hoc tests used in the context of ANOVA, this adjustment is used to counteract the problem of Type I Error that occurs when multiple comparisons are made. Following a Chi-Square test that includes an explanatory variable with 3 or more groups, we need to subset to each possible paired comparison. When interpreting these paired comparisons, rather than setting the \\(\\alpha\\)-level (p-value) at 0.05, we divide 0.05 by the number of paired comparisons that we will be making. The result is our new \\(\\alpha\\)-level (p-value). For example, if we have a significant Chi-Square when examining the association between number of cigarettes smoked per day (a 5 level categorical explanatory variable: 1-5 cigarettes; 6 -10 cigarettes; 11–15 cigarettes; 16-20 cigarettes; and &gt;20) and nicotine dependence (a two level categorical response variable – yes vs. no), we will want to know which pairs of the 5 cigarette groups are different from one another with respect to rates of nicotine dependence. In other words, we will make \\(\\binom{5}{2}=10\\) comparisons (all possible comparisons). We will compare group 1 to 2; 1 to 3; 1 to 4; 1 to 5; 2 to 3; 2 to 4; 2 to 5; 3 to 4; 3 to 5; 4 to 5. When we evaluate the p-value for each of these post hoc chi-square tests, we will use 0.05/10 = 0.005 as our alpha. If the p-value is &lt; 0.005 then we will reject the null hypothesis. If it is &gt; 0.005, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Let’s start with an example: Example Highway Signs8 A Pennsylvania research firm conducted a study in which 30 drivers (of ages 18 to 82 years old) were sampled, and for each one, the maximum distance (in feet) at which he/she could read a newly designed sign was determined. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between a driver’s age and the maximum distance at which signs were legible, and then use the study’s findings to improve safety for older drivers. (Reference: Utts and Heckard, Mind on Statistics (2002). Originally source: Data collected by Last Resource, Inc, Bellfonte, PA.) Since the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of age on maximum legibility distance, the explanatory variable is Age, and the response variable is Distance. Here is what the first six rows of raw data look like: Age Distance 18 510 20 590 22 560 23 510 23 460 25 490 Note that the data structure is such that for each individual (in this case driver 1….driver 30) we have a pair of values (in this case representing the driver’s age and distance). We can therefore think about these data as 30 pairs of values: (18, 510), (32, 410), (55, 420), … , (82, 360). The first step in exploring the relationship between driver age and sign legibility distance is to create an appropriate and informative graphical display. The appropriate graphical display for examining the relationship between two quantitative variables is the scatterplot. Here is how a scatterplot is constructed for our example: To create a scatterplot, each pair of values is plotted, so that the value of the explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the value of the response variable (\\(Y\\)) is plotted on the vertical axis. In other words, each individual (driver, in our example) appears on the scatterplot as a single point whose \\(X\\)-coordinate is the value of the explanatory variable for that individual, and whose \\(Y\\)-coordinate is the value of the response variable. Here is an illustration: library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = signdist, aes(x = Age, y = Distance)) + geom_point(color = &quot;purple&quot;) + theme_bw() Comment It is important to mention again that when creating a scatterplot, the explanatory variable should always be plotted on the horizontal \\(X\\)-axis, and the response variable should be plotted on the vertical \\(Y\\)-axis. If in a specific example we do not have a clear distinction between explanatory and response variables, each of the variables can be plotted on either axis. 13.1 Interpreting the scatterplot How do we explore the relationship between two quantitative variables using the scatterplot? What should we look at, or pay attention to? Recall that when we described the distribution of a single quantitative variable with a histogram, we described the overall pattern of the distribution (shape, center, spread) and any deviations from that pattern (outliers). We do the same thing with the scatterplot. The following figure summarizes this point: As the figure explains, when describing the overall pattern of the relationship we look at its direction, form and strength. The direction of the relationship can be positive, negative, or neither: A positive (or increasing) relationship means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with an increase in the other. A negative (or decreasing) relationship means that an increase in one of the variables is associated with a decrease in the other. Not all relationships can be classified as either positive or negative. The form of the relationship is its general shape. When identifying the form, we try to find the simplest way to describe the shape of the scatterplot. There are many possible forms. Here are a couple that are quite common: Relationships with a linear form are most simply described as points scattered about a line: Relationships with a curvilinear form are most simply described as points dispersed around the same curved line: There are many other possible forms for the relationship between two quantitative variables, but linear and curvilinear forms are quite common and easy to identify. Another form-related pattern that we should be aware of is clusters in the data: The strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data follow the form of the relationship. Let’s look, for example, at the following two scatterplots displaying positive, linear relationships: The strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data points follow the form. We can see that in the top scatterplot the data points follow the linear pattern quite closely. This is an example of a strong relationship. In the bottom scatterplot, the points also follow the linear pattern, but much less closely, and therefore we can say that the relationship is weaker. In general, though, assessing the strength of a relationship just by looking at the scatterplot is quite problematic, and we need a numerical measure to help us with that. We will discuss that later in this section. Data points that deviate from the pattern of the relationship are called outliers. We will see several examples of outliers during this section. Two outliers are illustrated in the scatterplot below: Let’s go back now to our example, and use the scatterplot to examine the relationship between the age of the driver and the maximum sign legibility distance. Here is the scatterplot: library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = signdist, aes(x = Age, y = Distance)) + geom_point(color = &quot;purple&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;Drivers Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Sign Legibility Distance (feet)&quot;) The direction of the relationship is negative, which makes sense in context, since as you get older your eyesight weakens, and in particular older drivers tend to be able to read signs only at lesser distances. An arrow drawn over the scatterplot illustrates the negative direction of this relationship: ggplot(data = signdist, aes(x = Age, y = Distance)) + geom_point(color = &quot;purple&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;Drivers Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Sign Legibility Distance (feet)&quot;) + stat_smooth(method = lm) The form of the relationship seems to be linear. Notice how the points tend to be scattered about the line. Although, as we mentioned earlier, it is problematic to assess the strength without a numerical measure, the relationship appears to be moderately strong, as the data is fairly tightly scattered about the line. Finally, all the data points seem to “obey” the pattern—there do not appear to be any outliers. 13.2 The Correlation Coefficient The numerical measure that assesses the strength of a linear relationship is called the correlation coefficient, and is denoted by \\(r\\). We will: give a definition of the correlation \\(r\\), discuss the calculation of \\(r\\), explain how to interpret the value of \\(r\\), and talk about some of the properties of \\(r\\). Definition: The correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) is a numerical measure that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Calculation: \\(r\\) is calculated using the following formula: \\(r = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s_x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y_i - \\bar{y}}{s_y}\\right)\\) However, the calculation of the correlation (\\(r\\)) is not the focus of this course. We will use a statistics package to calculate \\(r\\) for us, and the emphasis of this course will be on the interpretation of its value. Interpretation Once we obtain the value of \\(r\\), its interpretation with respect to the strength of linear relationships is quite simple, as this walk-through will illustrate: In order to get a better sense for how the value of r relates to the strength of the linear relationship, take a look at this applet. The slider bar at the bottom of the applet allows us to vary the value of the correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) between -1 and 1 in order to observe the effect on a scatterplot. (If the plot does not change on your browser when you move the slider, click along the bar instead to update the plot). Now that we understand the use of r as a numerical measure for assessing the direction and strength of linear relationships between quantitative variables, we will look at a few examples. Example Highway Sign Visibility Earlier, we used the scatterplot below to find a negative linear relationship between the age of a driver and the maximum distance at which a highway sign was legible. What about the strength of the relationship? It turns out that the correlation between the two variables is \\(r = -0.8012447\\). cor(signdist$Age, signdist$Distance) [1] -0.8012447 cor.test(signdist$Age, signdist$Distance) Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation data: signdist$Age and signdist$Distance t = -7.086, df = 28, p-value = 1.041e-07 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.9013320 -0.6199255 sample estimates: cor -0.8012447 ggplot(data = signdist, aes(x = Age, y = Distance)) + geom_point(color = &quot;purple&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;Drivers Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Sign Legibility Distance (feet)&quot;) + stat_smooth(method = lm) Since \\(r &lt; 0\\), it confirms that the direction of the relationship is negative (although we really didn’t need \\(r\\) to tell us that). Since \\(r\\) is relatively close to -1, it suggests that the relationship is moderately strong. In context, the negative correlation confirms that the maximum distance at which a sign is legible generally decreases with age. Since the value of \\(r\\) indicates that the linear relationship is moderately strong, but not perfect, we can expect the maximum distance to vary somewhat, even among drivers of the same age. Example Statistics Courses A statistics department is interested in tracking the progress of its students from entry until graduation. As part of the study, the department tabulates the performance of 10 students in an introductory course and in an upper-level course required for graduation. What is the relationship between the students’ course averages in the two courses? Here is the scatterplot for the data: The scatterplot suggests a relationship that is positive in direction, linear in form, and seems quite strong. The value of the correlation that we find between the two variables is \\(r = 0.931\\), which is very close to 1, and thus confirms that indeed the linear relationship is very strong. Pearson Correlation A correlation coefficient assesses the degree of linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from \\(+1\\) to \\(-1\\). A correlation of \\(+1\\) means that there is a perfect, positive, linear relationship between the two variables. A correlation of \\(-1\\) means there is a perfect, negative linear relationship between the two variables. In both cases, knowing the value of one variable, you can perfectly predict the value of the second. Pearson Correlation Assignment Post syntax to your private GitHub repo used to generate a correlation coefficient along with corresponding output and a few sentences of interpretation. Note: When we square \\(r\\), it tells us what proportion of the variability in one variable is described by variation in the second variable (aka \\(R^2\\) or Coefficient of Determination).

["chapter-13.html", "Chapter 14 Chapter", " Chapter 14 Chapter Moderation Please watch the Chapter 14 Video. In statistics and regression analysis, moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The third variable is referred to as the moderator variable or simply the moderator. The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a categorical (e.g., sex, race, class) or quantitative (e.g., level of reward) variable that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between dependent and independent variables. Specifically within a correlational analysis framework, a moderator is a third variable that affects the zero-order correlation between two other variables, or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, a basic moderator effect can be represented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.9 Examples: I have hypotheses about the association between smoking quantity and nicotine dependence for individuals with and without depression (the moderator). For example, for those with depression, any amount of smoking may indicate substantial risk for nicotine dependence (i.e. at both low and high levels of daily smoking), while among those without depression, smoking quantity might be expected to be more clearly associated with likelihood of experiencing nicotine dependence (i.e. the more one smokes, the more likely they are to be nicotine dependent). In other words, I am hypothesizing a non-significant association between smoking and nicotine dependence for individuals with depression and a significant, positive association between smoking and nicotine dependence for individuals without depression. To test this, I can run two ANOVA tests, one examining the association between nicotine dependence (categorical) and level of smoking (quantitative) for those with depression and one examining the association between nicotine dependence (categorical) and level of smoking (quantitative) for those without depression. mod1 &lt;- aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ TobaccoDependence, data = nesarc[nesarc$MajorDepression == &quot;Yes Depression&quot;, ]) summary(mod1) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) TobaccoDependence 1 1120 1120 13.83 0.000233 *** Residuals 351 28430 81 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 2 observations deleted due to missingness mod2 &lt;- aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ TobaccoDependence, data = nesarc[nesarc$MajorDepression == &quot;No Depression&quot;, ]) summary(mod2) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) TobaccoDependence 1 2105 2104.7 30.3 4.75e-08 *** Residuals 960 66681 69.5 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 3 observations deleted due to missingness mod3 &lt;- aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ TobaccoDependence*MajorDepression, data = nesarc) summary(mod3) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) TobaccoDependence 1 3241 3241 44.669 3.44e-11 *** MajorDepression 1 9 9 0.125 0.724 TobaccoDependence:MajorDepression 1 116 116 1.595 0.207 Residuals 1311 95111 73 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 5 observations deleted due to missingness The results show a significant association between smoking and nicotine dependence such that the greater the smoking, the higher the rate of nicotine dependence among those individuals with and without depression. In this example, we would say that depression does not moderate the relationship between smoking and nicotine dependence.

For those individuals with alcohol dependence, I believe that smoking and nicotine dependence will not be associated (i.e there will be high rates nicotine dependence at low, moderate and high levels of smoking), while among those without alcohol dependence, smoking quantity will be significantly associated with the likelihood of experiencing nicotine dependence (i.e. the more one smokes, the more likely he/she is to be nicotine dependent). In other words, I am hypothesizing a non-significant association between smoking and nicotine dependence for individuals with alcohol dependence and a significant,positive association between smoking and nicotine dependence for individuals without alcohol dependence. To test this, I run two ANOVA tests, one examining the association between smoking and nicotine dependence for those with alcohol dependence and one examining the association between smoking and nicotine dependence for those without alcohol dependence. mod4 &lt;- aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ TobaccoDependence, data = nesarc[nesarc$AlcoholAD == &quot;No Alcohol&quot;, ]) summary(mod4) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) TobaccoDependence 1 2199 2199.5 35.7 3.53e-09 *** Residuals 761 46881 61.6 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 5 observations deleted due to missingness mod5 &lt;- aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ TobaccoDependence, data = nesarc[nesarc$AlcoholAD == &quot;Alcohol Dependence&quot;, ]) summary(mod5) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) TobaccoDependence 1 36 36.05 1.005 0.32 Residuals 60 2151 35.85 mod6 &lt;- aov(DailyCigsSmoked ~ TobaccoDependence*AlcoholAD, data = nesarc) summary(mod6) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) TobaccoDependence 1 3241 3241 45.911 1.87e-11 *** AlcoholAD 3 2631 877 12.425 5.15e-08 *** TobaccoDependence:AlcoholAD 3 351 117 1.656 0.175 Residuals 1307 92254 71 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 5 observations deleted due to missingness # Graphing the interaction ggplot(data = nesarc, aes(x = AlcoholAD, y = DailyCigsSmoked, shape = TobaccoDependence, group = TobaccoDependence, linetype = TobaccoDependence)) + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, na.rm = TRUE, geom = &quot;point&quot;) + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, na.rm = TRUE, geom = &quot;line&quot;) + labs(y = &quot;Mean Daily Cigarettes Smoked&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;) + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) + theme_bw() The results show that there is a significant association between smoking and nicotine dependence but, as I hypothesized, sized, only for those without alcohol dependence. That is, for those without alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence is positively associated with level of smoking. In contrast, for those with alcohol dependence, the association between smoking and nicotine dependence is non-significant (statistically similar rates of nicotine dependence at every level of smoking). Because the relationship between the explanatory variable (smoking) and the response variable (nicotine dependence) is different based on the presence or absence of our third variable (alcohol dependence), we would say that alcohol dependence moderates the relationship between nicotine dependence and smoking. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_(statistics)↩ "],
["chapter-14.html", "Chapter 15 Chapter", " Chapter 15 Chapter Linear Regression: Summarizing the Pattern of the Data with a Line10 So far we’ve used the scatterplot to describe the relationship between two quantitative variables, and in the special case of a linear relationship, we have supplemented the scatterplot with the correlation (\\(r\\)). The correlation, however, doesn’t fully characterize the linear relationship between two quantitative variables—it only measures the strength and direction. We often want to describe more precisely how one variable changes with the other (by “more precisely,” we mean more than just the direction), or predict the value of the response variable for a given value of the explanatory variable. In order to be able to do that, we need to summarize the linear relationship with a line that best fits the linear pattern of the data. In the remainder of this section, we will introduce a way to find such a line, learn how to interpret it, and use it (cautiously) to make predictions. Again, let’s start with a motivating example: Earlier, we examined the linear relationship between the age of a driver and the maximum distance at which a highway sign was legible, using both a scatterplot and the correlation coefficient. Suppose a government agency wanted to predict the maximum distance at which the sign would be legible for 60-year-old drivers, and thus make sure that the sign could be used safely and effectively. How would we make this prediction? library(PDS) mod.lm &lt;- lm(Distance ~ Age, data = signdist) summary(mod.lm) Call: lm(formula = Distance ~ Age, data = signdist) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -78.231 -41.710 7.646 33.552 108.831 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

When that dependence is linear (which is the case in our examples in this section), the technique is called linear regression. Linear regression is therefore the technique of finding the line that best fits the pattern of the linear relationship (or in other words, the line that best describes how the response variable linearly depends on the explanatory variable). To understand how such a line is chosen, consider the following very simplified version of the age-distance example (we left just 6 of the drivers on the scatterplot): There are many lines that look like they would be good candidates to be the line that best fits the data: It is doubtful that everyone would select the same line in the plot above. We need to agree on what we mean by “best fits the data”; in other words, we need to agree on a criterion by which we would select this line. We want the line we choose to be close to the data points. In other words, whatever criterion we choose, it had better somehow take into account the vertical deviations of the data points from the line, which are marked with blue arrows in the plot below: The most commonly used criterion is called the least squares criterion. This criterion says: Among all the lines that look good on your data, choose the one that has the smallest sum of squared vertical deviations. Visually, each squared deviation is represented by the area of one of the squares in the plot below. Therefore, we are looking for the line that will have the smallest total yellow area. This line is called the least-squares regression line, and, as we’ll see, it fits the linear pattern of the data very well. For the remainder of this lesson, you’ll need to feel comfortable with the algebra of a straight line. In particular you’ll need to be familiar with the slope and the intercept in the equation of a line, and their interpretation. Like any other line, the equation of the least-squares regression line for summarizing the linear relationship between the response variable (\\(Y\\)) and the explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) has the form: \\(Y = a + bX\\) All we need to do is calculate the intercept \\(a\\), and the slope \\(b\\), which is easily done if we know: \\(X\\)—the mean of the explanatory variable’s values \\(S_X\\)—the standard deviation of the explanatory variable’s values \\(Y\\)—the mean of the response variable’s values \\(S_Y\\)—the standard deviation of the response variable’s values \\(r\\)—the correlation coefficient Given the five quantities above, the slope and intercept of the least squares regression line are found using the following formulas: \\(b = r (S_Y/S_X)\\) \\(a = \\bar{Y} -b\\bar{x}\\) Comments Note that since the formula for the intercept a depends on the value of the slope, \\(b\\), you need to find \\(b\\) first. The slope of the least squares regression line can be interpreted as the average change in the response variable when the explanatory variable increases by 1 unit. Example Age-Distance Let’s revisit our age-distance example, and find the least-squares regression line. The following output will be helpful in getting the 5 values we need: MEAN &lt;- apply(signdist, 2, mean) MEAN Age Distance 51.0000 423.3333 cor(signdist) Age Distance Age 1.0000000 -0.8012447 Distance -0.8012447 1.0000000 SD &lt;- apply(signdist, 2, sd) SD Age Distance 21.77629 81.72002 mod.lm &lt;- lm(Distance ~ Age, data = signdist) coef(summary(mod.lm)) Estimate Std.

This means that for every 1-unit increase of the explanatory variable, there is, on average, a -3.0068354-unit decrease in the response variable. The interpretation in context of the slope being -3.0068354 is, therefore: For every year a driver gets older, the maximum distance at which he/she can read a sign decreases, on average, by 3.0068354 feet. The intercept of the line is: \\[a = 423.3333333 + 3.0068354\\times 51 = 576.6819372\\] and therefore the least squares regression line for this example is: \\[\\widehat{\\text{Distance}} = 576.6819372 -3.0068354\\times \\text{Age}\\] Here is the regression line plotted on the scatterplot: ggplot(data = signdist, aes(x = Age, y = Distance)) + geom_point(color = &quot;purple&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(x = &quot;Drivers Age (years)&quot;, y = &quot;Sign Legibility Distance (feet)&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(title = expression(hat(Y) == &quot;576.7 - 3x&quot;) ) As we can see, the regression line fits the linear pattern of the data quite well. Comment As we mentioned before, hand-calculation is not the focus of this course. We wanted you to see one example in which the least squares regression line is calculated by hand, but in general we’ll let a statistics package do that for us. Let’s go back now to our motivating example, in which we wanted to predict the maximum distance at which a sign is legible for a 60-year-old. Now that we have found the least squares regression line, this prediction becomes quite easy: Practically, what the figure tells us is that in order to find the predicted legibility distance for a 60-year-old, we plug Age = 60 into the regression line equation, to find that: Predicted distance = \\(576.6819372 + (-3.0068354 \\times 60) = 396.271815\\). 396.271815 feet is our best prediction for the maximum distance at which a sign is legible for a 60-year-old. https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=434b85ba80020ca600a81f9419678a69↩ "],
["chapter-15.html", "Chapter 16 Chapter 16.1 Sampling and Designing Studies 16.2 Designing Studies 16.3 Identifying Study Design 16.4 Experiments vs. Observational Studies", " Chapter 16 Chapter 16.1 Sampling and Designing Studies Suppose you want to determine the musical preferences of all students at your university, based on a sample of students. Here are some examples of the many possible ways to pursue this problem.11 Example 1 Post a music-lovers’ survey on a university IInternet bulletin board, asking students to vote for their favorite type of music. This is an example of a volunteer sample, where individuals have selected themselves to be included. Such a sample is almost guaranteed to be biased. In general, volunteer samples tend to be comprised of individuals who have a particularly strong opinion about an issue, and are looking for an opportunity to voice it. Whether the variable’s values obtained from such a sample are over- or under-stated, and to what extent, cannot be determined. As a result, data obtained from a voluntary response sample is quite useless when you think about the “Big Picture,” since the sampled individuals only provide information about themselves, and we cannot generalize to any larger group at all. Note Comment: It should be mentioned that in some cases volunteer samples are the only ethical way to obtain a sample. In medical studies, for example, in which new treatments are tested, subjects must choose to participate by signing a consent form that highlights the potential risks and benefits. As we will discuss in the next module, a volunteer sample is not so problematic in a study conducted for the purpose of comparing several treatments. Example 2 Stand outside the Student Union, across from the Fine Arts Building, and ask students passing by to respond to your question about musical preference. This is an example of a convenience sample, where individuals happen to be at the right time and place to suit the schedule of the researcher. Depending on what variable is being studied, it may be that a convenience sample provides a fairly representative group. However, there are often subtle reasons why the sample’s results are biased. In this case, the proximity to the Fine Arts Building might result in a disproportionate number of students favoring classical music. A convenience sample may also be susceptible to bias because certain types of individuals are more likely to be selected than others. In the extreme, some convenience samples are designed in such a way that certain individuals have no chance at all of being selected, as in the next example. Example 3 Ask your professors for email rosters of all the students in your classes. Randomly sample some addresses, and email those students with your question about musical preference. Here is a case where the sampling frame—list of potential individuals to be sampled—does not match the population of interest. The population of interest consists of all students at the university, whereas the sampling frame consists of only your classmates. There may be bias arising because of this discrepancy. For example, students with similar majors will tend to take the same classes as you, and their musical preferences may also be somewhat different from those of the general population of students. It is always best to have the sampling frame match the population as closely as possible. Example 4 Obtain a student directory with email addresses of all the university’s students, and send the music poll to every 50th name on the list. This is called systematic sampling. It may not be subject to any clear bias, but it would not be as safe as taking a random sample. If individuals are sampled completely at random, and without replacement, then each group of a given size is just as likely to be selected as all the other groups of that size. This is called a simple random sample (SRS). In contrast, a systematic sample would not allow for sibling students to be selected, because of having the same last name. In a simple random sample, sibling students would have just as much of a chance of both being selected as any other pair of students. Therefore, there may be subtle sources of bias in using a systematic sampling plan. Example 5 Obtain a student directory with email addresses of all the university’s students, and send your music poll to a simple random sample of students. As long as all of the students respond, then the sample is not subject to any bias, and should succeed in being representative of the population of interest. But what if only 40% of those selected email you back with their vote? The results of this poll would not necessarily be representative of the population, because of the potential problems associated with volunteer response. Since individuals are not compelled to respond, often a relatively small subset take the trouble to participate. Volunteer response is not as problematic as a volunteer sample (presented in example 1 above), but there is still a danger that those who do respond are different from those who don’t, with respect to the variable of interest. An improvement would be to follow up with a second email, asking politely for students’ cooperation. This may boost the response rate, resulting in a sample that is fairly representative of the entire population of interest, and it may be the best that you can do, under the circumstances. Nonresponse is still an issue, but at least you have managed to reduce its impact on your results. So far we’ve discussed several sampling plans, and determined that a simple random sample is the only one we discussed that is not subject to any bias. A simple random sample is the easiest way to base a selection on randomness. There are other, more sophisticated, sampling techniques that utilize randomness that are often preferable in real-life circumstances. Any plan that relies on random selection is called a probability sampling plan (or technique). The following three probability sampling plans are among the most commonly used: Simple Random Sampling is, as the name suggests, the simplest probability sampling plan. It is equivalent to “selecting names out of a hat.” Each individual as the same chance of being selected. Cluster Sampling—This sampling technique is used when our population is naturally divided into groups (which we call clusters). For example, all the students in a university are divided into majors; all the nurses in a certain city are divided into hospitals; all registered voters are divided into precincts (election districts). In cluster sampling, we take a random sample of clusters, and use all the individuals within the selected clusters as our sample. For example, in order to get a sample of high-school seniors from a certain city, you choose 3 high schools at random from among all the high schools in that city, and use all the high school seniors in the three selected high schools as your sample. Stratified Sampling—Stratified sampling is used when our population is naturally divided into sub-populations, which we call stratum (plural: strata). For example, all the students in a certain college are divided by gender or by year in college; all the registered voters in a certain city are divided by race. In stratified sampling, we choose a simple random sample from each stratum, and our sample consists of all these simple random samples put together. For example, in order to get a random sample of high-school seniors from a certain city, we choose a random sample of 25 seniors from each of the high schools in that city. Our sample consists of all these samples put together. Each of those probability sampling plans, if applied correctly, are not subject to any bias, and thus produce samples that represent well the population from which they were drawn. Comment: Cluster vs. Stratified Students sometimes get confused about the difference between cluster sampling and stratified sampling. Even though both methods start out with the population somehow divided into groups, the two methods are very different. In cluster sampling, we take a random sample of whole groups of individuals, while in stratified sampling we take a simple random sample from each group. For example, say we want to conduct a study on the sleeping habits of undergraduate students at a certain university, and need to obtain a sample. The students are naturally divided by majors, and let’s say that in this university there are 40 different majors. In cluster sampling, we would randomly choose, say, 5 majors (groups) out of the 40, and use all the students in these five majors as our sample. In stratified sampling, we would obtain a random sample of, say, 10 students from each of the 40 majors (groups), and use the 400 chosen students as the sample. Clearly in this example, stratified sampling is much better, since the major of the student might have an effect on the student’s sleeping habits, and so we would like to make sure that we have representatives from all the different majors. We’ll stress this point again following the example and activity. Example Suppose you would like to study the job satisfaction of hospital nurses in a certain city based on a sample. Besides taking a simple random sample, here are two additional ways to obtain such a sample. Suppose that the city has 10 hospitals. Choose one of the 10 hospitals at random and interview all the nurses in that hospital regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example of cluster sampling, in which the hospitals are the clusters. Choose a random sample of 50 nurses from each of the 10 hospitals and interview these 50 * 10 = 500 regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example of stratified sampling, in which each hospital is a stratum. Cluster or Stratified—which one is better? Let’s go back and revisit the job satisfaction of hospital nurses example and discuss the pros and cons of the two sampling plans that are presented. Certainly, it will be much easier to conduct the study using the cluster sample, since all interviews are conducted in one hospital as opposed to the stratified sample, in which the interviews need to be conducted in 10 different hospitals. However, the hospital that a nurse works in probably has a direct impact on his/her job satisfaction, and in that sense, getting data from just one hospital might provide biased results. In this case, it will be very important to have representation from all the city hospitals, and therefore the stratified sample is definitely preferable. On the other hand, say that instead of job satisfaction, our study focuses on the age or weight of hospital nurses. In this case, it is probably not as crucial to get representation from the different hospitals, and therefore the more easily obtained cluster sample might be preferable. Comment: Another commonly used sampling technique is multistage sampling, which is essentially a “complex form” of cluster sampling. When conducting cluster sampling, it might be unrealistic, or too expensive to sample all the individuals in the chosen clusters. In cases like this, it would make sense to have another stage of sampling, in which you choose a sample from each of the randomly selected clusters, hence the term multistage sampling. For example, say you would like to study the exercise habits of college students in the state of California. You might choose 8 colleges (clusters) at random, but you are certainly not going to use all the students in these 8 colleges as your sample. It is simply not realistic to conduct your study that way. Instead you move on to stage 2 of your sampling plan, in which you choose a random sample of 100 males and a random sample of 100 females from each of the 8 colleges you selected in stage 1. So in total you have \\(8 \\times (100+100) = 1,600\\) college students in your sample. In this case, stage 1 was a cluster sample of 8 colleges and stage 2 was a stratified sample within each college where the stratum was gender. Multistage sampling can have more than 2 stages. For example, to obtain a random sample of physicians in the United States, you choose 10 states at random (stage 1, cluster). From each state you choose at random 8 hospitals (stage 2, cluster). Finally, from each hospital, you choose 5 physicians from each sub-specialty (stage 3, stratified). 16.2 Designing Studies Obviously, sampling is not done for its own sake. After this first stage in the data production process is completed, we come to the second stage, that of gaining information about the variables of interest from the sampled individuals. In this module we’ll discuss three study designs; each design enables you to determine the values of the variables in a different way. You can: Carry out an observational study, in which values of the variable or variables of interest are recorded as they naturally occur. There is no interference by the researchers who conduct the study. Take a sample survey, which is a particular type of observational study in which individuals report variables’ values themselves, frequently by giving their opinions. Perform an experiment. Instead of assessing the values of the variables as they naturally occur, the researchers interfere, and they are the ones who assign the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals. The researchers “take control” of the values of the explanatory variable because they want to see how changes in the value of the explanatory variable affect the response variable. (Note: By nature, any experiment involves at least two variables.) The type of design used, and the details of the design, are crucial, since they will determine what kind of conclusions we may draw from the results. In particular, when studying relationships in the Exploratory Data Analysis unit, we stressed that an association between two variables does not guarantee that a causal relationship exists. In this module, we will explore how the details of a study design play a crucial role in determining our ability to establish evidence of causation. 16.3 Identifying Study Design Because each type of study design has its own advantages and trouble spots, it is important to begin by determining what type of study we are dealing with. The following example helps to illustrate how we can distinguish among the three basic types of design mentioned in the introduction—observational studies, sample surveys, and experiments. Suppose researchers want to determine whether people tend to snack more while they watch television. In other words, the researchers would like to explore the relationship between the explanatory variable “TV” (a categorical variable that takes the values “on’” and “not on”) and the response variable “snack consumption.” Identify each of the following designs as being an observational study, a sample survey, or an experiment. Recruit participants for a study. While they are presumably waiting to be interviewed, half of the individuals sit in a waiting room with snacks available and a TV on. The other half sit in a waiting room with snacks available and no TV, just magazines. Researchers determine whether people consume more snacks in the TV setting. This is an experiment, because the researchers take control of the explanatory variable of interest (TV on or not) by assigning each individual to either watch TV or not, and determine the effect that has on the response variable of interest (snack consumption). Recruit participants for a study. Give them journals to record hour by hour their activities the following day, including when they watch TV and when they consume snacks. Determine if snack consumption is higher during TV times. This is an observational study, because the participants themselves determine whether or not to watch TV. There is no attempt on the researchers’ part to interfere. Recruit participants for a study. Ask them to recall, for each hour of the previous day, whether they were watching TV, and what snacks they consumed each hour. Determine whether snack consumption was higher during the TV times. This is also an observational study; again, it was the participants themselves who decided whether or not to watch TV. Do you see the difference between 2 and 3? See the comment below. Poll a sample of individuals with the following question: While watching TV, do you tend to snack: (a) less than usual; (b) more than usual; or (c) the same amount as usual? This is a sample survey, because the individuals self-assess the relationship between TV watching and snacking. Comment Notice that in Example 2, the values of the variables of interest (TV watching and snack consumption) are recorded forward in time. Such observational studies are called prospective. In contrast, in Example 3, the values of the variables of interest are recorded backward in time. This is called a retrospective observational study. While some studies are designed to gather information about a single variable, many studies attempt to draw conclusions about the relationship between two variables. In particular, researchers often would like to produce evidence that one variable actually causes changes in the other. For example, the research question addressed in the previous example sought to establish evidence that watching TV could cause an increase in snacking. Such studies may be especially useful and interesting, but they are also especially vulnerable to flaws that could invalidate the conclusion of causation. In several of the examples in this module we will see that although evidence of an association between two variables may be quite clear, the question of whether one variable is actually causing changes in the other may be too murky to be entirely resolved. In general, with a well-designed experiment we have a better chance of establishing causation than with an observational study. However, experiments are also subject to certain pitfalls, and there are many situations in which an experiment is not an option. A well-designed observational study may still provide fairly convincing evidence of causation under the right circumstances. 16.4 Experiments vs. Observational Studies Before assessing the effectiveness of observational studies and experiments for producing evidence of a causal relationship between two variables, we will illustrate the essential differences between these two designs. Every day, a huge number of people are engaged in a struggle whose outcome could literally affect the length and quality of their life: they are trying to quit smoking. Just the array of techniques, products, and promises available shows that quitting is not easy, nor is its success guaranteed. Researchers would like to determine which of the following is the best method: Drugs that alleviate nicotine addiction. Therapy that trains smokers to quit. A combination of drugs and therapy. Neither form of intervention (quitting “cold turkey”). The explanatory variable is the method (1, 2, 3 or 4) , while the response variable is eventual success or failure in quitting. In an observational study, values of the explanatory variable occur naturally. In this case, this means that the participants themselves choose a method of trying to quit smoking. In an experiment, researchers assign the values of the explanatory variable. In other words, they tell people what method to use. Let us consider how we might compare the four techniques, via either an observational study or an experiment. An observational study of the relationship between these two variables requires us to collect a representative sample from the population of smokers who are beginning to try to quit. We can imagine that a substantial proportion of that population is trying one of the four above methods. In order to obtain a representative sample, we might use a nationwide telephone survey to identify 1,000 smokers who are just beginning to quit smoking. We record which of the four methods the smokers use. One year later, we contact the same 1,000 individuals and determine whether they succeeded. In an experiment, we again collect a representative sample from the population of smokers who are just now trying to quit, using a nationwide telephone survey of 1,000 individuals. This time, however, we divide the sample into 4 groups of 250 and assign each group to use one of the four methods to quit. One year later, we contact the same 1,000 individuals and determine whose attempts succeeded while using our designated method. The following figures illustrate the two study designs: Observational study: Experiment: Both the observational study and the experiment begin with a random sample from the population of smokers just now beginning to quit. In both cases, the individuals in the sample can be divided into categories based on the values of the explanatory variable: method used to quit. The response variable is success or failure after one year. Finally, in both cases, we would assess the relationship between the variables by comparing the proportions of success of the individuals using each method, using a two-way table and conditional percentages. The only difference between the two methods is the way the sample is divided into categories for the explanatory variable (method). In the observational study, individuals are divided based upon the method by which they choose to quit smoking. The researcher does not assign the values of the explanatory variable, but rather records them as they naturally occur. In the experiment, the researcher deliberately assigns one of the four methods to each individual in the sample. The researcher intervenes by controlling the explanatory variable, and then assesses its relationship with the response variable. Now that we have outlined two possible study designs, let’s return to the original question: which of the four methods for quitting smoking is most successful? Suppose the study’s results indicate that individuals who try to quit with the combination drug/therapy method have the highest rate of success, and those who try to quit with neither form of intervention have the lowest rate of success, as illustrated in the hypothetical two-way table below: Can we conclude that using the combination drugs and therapy method caused the smokers to quit most successfully? Which type of design was implemented will play an important role in the answer to this question. https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=434b868a80020ca600eda22f1586f085↩ "],

Suppose the observational study described on the previous page were carried out, and researchers determined that the percentage succeeding with the combination drug/therapy method was highest, while the percentage succeeding with neither therapy nor drugs was lowest. In other words, suppose there is clear evidence of an association between method used and success rate. Could they then conclude that the combination drug/therapy method causes success more than using neither therapy nor a drug? It is at precisely this point that we confront the underlying weakness of most observational studies: some members of the sample have opted for certain values of the explanatory variable (method of quitting), while others have opted for other values. It could be that those individuals may be different in additional ways that would also play a role in the response of interest. For instance, suppose women are more likely to choose certain methods to quit, and suppose women in general tend to quit more successfully than men. The data would make it appear that the method itself were responsible for success, whereas in truth it may just be that being female is the reason for success. We can express this scenario in terms of the key variables involved. In addition to the explanatory variable (method) and the response variable (success or failure), a third, lurking variable (gender) is tied in (or confounded) with the explanatory variable’s values, and may itself cause the response to be success or failure. The following diagram illustrates this situation. Since the difficulty arises because of the lurking variable’s values being tied in with those of the explanatory variable, one way to attempt to unravel the true nature of the relationship between explanatory and response variables is to separate out the effects of the lurking variable. In general, we control for the effects of a lurking variable by separately studying groups that are similar with respect to this variable. We could control for the lurking variable “gender” by studying women and men separately. Then, if both women and men who chose one method have higher success rates than those opting for another method, we would be closer to producing evidence of causation. The diagram above demonstrates how straightforward it is to control for the lurking variable gender. Notice that we did not claim that controlling for gender would allow us to make a definite claim of causation, only that we would be closer to establishing a causal connection. This is due to the fact that other lurking variables may also be involved, such as the level of the participants’ desire to quit. Specifically, those who have chosen to use the drug/therapy method may already be the ones who are most determined to succeed, while those who have chosen to quit without investing in drugs or therapy may, from the outset, be less committed to quitting. The following diagram illustrates this scenario. To attempt to control for this lurking variable, we could interview the individuals at the outset in order to rate their desire to quit on a scale of 1 (weakest) to 5 (strongest), and study the relationship between method and success separately for each of the five groups. But desire to quit is obviously a very subjective thing, difficult to assign a specific number to. Realistically, we may be unable to effectively control for the lurking variable “desire to quit.” Furthermore, who’s to say that gender and/or desire to quit are the only lurking variables involved? There may be other subtle differences among individuals who choose one of the four various methods that researchers fail to imagine as they attempt to control for possible lurking variables. For example, smokers who opt to quit using neither therapy nor drugs may tend to be in a lower income bracket than those who opt for (and can afford) drugs and/or therapy. Perhaps smokers in a lower income bracket also tend to be less successful in quitting because more of their family members and co-workers smoke. Thus, socioeconomic status is yet another possible lurking variable in the relationship between cessation method and success rate. It is because of the existence of a virtually unlimited number of potential lurking variables that we can never be 100% certain of a claim of causation based on an observational study. On the other hand, observational studies are an extremely common tool used by researchers to attempt to draw conclusions about causal connections. If great care is taken to control for the most likely lurking variables (and to avoid other pitfalls which we will discuss presently), and if common sense indicates that there is good reason for one variable to cause changes in the other, then researchers may assert that an observational study provides good evidence of causation. Confounding So far we have discussed different ways in which data can be used to explore the relationship (or association) between two variables. When we explore the relationship between two variables, there is often a temptation to conclude from the observed relationship that changes in the explanatory variable cause changes in the response variable. In other words, you might be tempted to interpret the observed association as causation. The purpose of this part of the course is to convince you that this kind of interpretation is often wrong! The motto of this section is one of the most fundamental principles of this course: Association does not imply causation! Fire Damage The scatterplot below illustrates how the number of firefighters sent to fires (\\(X\\)) is related to the amount of damage caused by fires (\\(Y\\)) in a certain city. The scatterplot clearly displays a fairly strong (slightly curved) positive relationship between the two variables. Would it, then, be reasonable to conclude that sending more firefighters to a fire causes more damage, or that the city should send fewer firefighters to a fire, in order to decrease the amount of damage done by the fire? Of course not! So what is going on here? There is a third variable in the background—the seriousness of the fire—that is responsible for the observed relationship. More serious fires require more firefighters, and also cause more damage. The following figure will help you visualize this situation: Here, the seriousness of the fire is a confounding variable. In statistics, a confounding variable (also confounding factor, lurking variable, a confound, or confounder) is an extraneous variable that is associated (positively or negatively) with both the explanatory variable and response variable. We need to “control for” these factors to avoid incorrectly believing that the response variable is associated with the explanatory variable. Confounding is a major threat to the validity of inferences made about statistical associations. In the case of a confounding variable, the observed association with the response variable should be attributed to the confounder rather than the explanatory variable. In science, we test for confounders by including these “3rd variables” in our statistical models that may explain the association of interest. In other words, we want to demonstrate that our association of interest is significant even after controlling for potential confounders. Multivariate Modeling Because adding potential confounding variables to our statistical model can help us to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between variables or lead us to rethink the direction of an association, it is important to learn about statistical tools that will allow us to examine multiple variables simultaneously (i.e. more than two or three). 1. Multiple Regression The general purpose of multiple regression is to learn more about the relationship between several independent or predictor variables and a quantitative dependent variable. Multiple regression procedures are very widely used in research. In general, this inferential tool allows us to ask (and hopefully answer) the general question “what is the best predictor of…”, and does “third variable a” or “third variable b” confound the relationship between my explanatory and response variable?” For example, educational researchers might want to learn about the best predictors of success in high-school. Sociologists may want to find out which of the multiple social indicators best predict whether or not a new immigrant group will adapt to their new country of residence. Biologists may want to find out which factors (i.e. temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, etc.) best predict caterpillar reproduction. In this clip on regression, we present the basic intuition behind regression analysis. Click here to view Movie 17.1 on Regression (30:03). 2. Logistic Regression Logistic regression is a multivariate statistical tool used to answer the same questions that can be answered with multiple regression. The difference is that logistic regression is used when the response variable (the outcome or Y variable) is binary (categorical with two levels). Note that if the response variable is categorical with more than two levels (ordered or nominal), it must be dichotomized (i.e. made into a binary, two level variable), so that logistic regression can be used. Both multiple regression and logistic regression allow for explanatory variables that are either quantitative, categorical, or both. Click here to view Movie 17.2 on Logistic Regression (1:18:53). Putting it all together In the next video clip, we demonstrate how to test and evaluate confounding within a multivariate model. Since the difficulty arises because of the lurking variable’s values being tied in with those of the explanatory variable, one way to attempt to unravel the true nature of the relationship between explanatory and response variables is to separate out the effects of the lurking variable.

["chapter-17.html", "Chapter 18 Chapter", " Chapter 18 Chapter Poster Presentation Please watch PREPARING YOUR FINAL PROJECT video. At the end of the semester, you will have the opportunity to present your research as a final project and presentation. What follows provides useful guidance for preparing each. These are only general guidelines. For detailed instructions on the poster and presentation, you will need to attend the scheduled in-class lecture. Poster The audience at a poster session is distractible and mobile. Your job in preparing your poster is to grab and keep their attention so that they will stay and take in your message. One study revealed that you have 11 seconds to grab a viewer’s attention. Whether they are engaged will depend both on the attractiveness of your presentation and on how daunting it appears at first glance. The most effective posters are easily digested. Sentences and paragraphs should be short, and type should be large. For viewers who want more information, the poster should provide an entry point to further discussion with the author about the project and the results. Keys to a successful poster Know who your audience is! As yours will be diverse (i.e. experts and non-experts), you will need to make a special effort to frame your question and results in an understandable and interesting way. Be brief! Distill it down…down… down… to the very essence of your project. Use figures and graphics where possible. Graphics are good attention-getters. But remember, the golden rule of figures (that they MUST be understandable without reference to accompanying text) applies doubly to posters. Layout is important! Because text is limited, layout is used to convey the logical structure of your argument. Use columns, boxes, arrows, bulleted lists, etc. to draw your viewer forward through your presentation. Be creative and make the viewing experience intellectually and esthetically satisfying. Reasons why posters fail Too much text. Keep each text block to just a few sentences. Large font size will be readable from far away and will help to keep you from using too many words. Unclear. If you leave out key elements, such as objectives, approach, detailed description of variables or conclusions, people who are not insiders on your subject will not understand what your goal was or why it is interesting. As one recent guest evaluator wrote: “students should be made aware of the technical language that they have grown accustomed to using and should learn to explain in detail the meaning of words such as proxy, gapminder, and other indicators such as poverty headcount ratio, since they are crucial to understanding their study. Not having them explained greatly impaired my understanding of their presentation.” Poor figures. Some figures are real puzzles, with incomprehensible legends, secret codes, small lettering, cryptic captions, etc. Many spreadsheet and data programs do not produce “reader friendly” graphics (see figures on final page), so you will need to budget extra time to customize your figures so that they are self-explanatory. Information overload. Most presenters try to do and say too much in one poster. Yes, your research may have yielded many subtle and intertwined results, BUT you will have to settle for one, two, or at most three take-home messages to convey on your poster. Presenter not present. Remember, the poster is just half of the presentation – you are the other half! Be there, so that those viewers who do find your work interesting will be able to engage you in discussion. Remember, poster sessions are interactive - a truly successful poster is an opportunity for the presenter to gain new knowledge and ideas. Find your message. Before you begin, try to formulate the essence of what you want to present in a single sentence. This exact sentence probably won’t appear on the poster itself, but it should be your guiding light in deciding what to include and where. Your title and conclusions should be derived directly from this sentence. Title. Your poster should include a banner title in a large font (e.g. 90 pt.). Below this, put the author(s) name(s) and institutional affiliation(s) in a slightly smaller font. Body text. Your body text should use a font readable at a distance of at least 4 feet (30 pt). Introduction. Write a few sentences that identify the problem you address, what is currently known about it (watch out for getting long-winded here!), and your approach to Investigating it. Consider using a bulleted list rather than a text block. Method. Sometimes, the Method section is included in a slightly smaller font so that those who only want the big picture can skip it. Results. Select the most pertinent results that support your message. Remove everything that is not absolutely necessary: avoid clutter. Think about the most attractive way to present the data in figures. Avoid tables if at all possible. Each illustration should have a headline title providing a take-home message with a more detailed caption below. Conclusion. Write the conclusion(s) in short, clear statements, preferably as a list. Attention-getters. An attractive title is important, but it must be supplemented by attractive graphics. There is no reason why all of your illustrations need to be the same size. Consider enlarging one of these illustrations (or a flow diagram, model, etc. that is the focus of your message) and placing it centrally to attract viewers. You will still need to pay attention to logical flow, directing the viewer’s attention (once you’ve captured it) up to and through this central illustration to your conclusions. Background. Do not use colored backgrounds or patterns as both are very distracting. Usually, plain white is best. Do use color in your figures in ways that enhance your message. Get feedback! Ask instructors, TA’s, and/or friends to comment on a draft version. Give yourself a break and review everything with a critical eye. Listen if someone says it’s too complicated – most first-time presenters try to cram far too much into their posters. Presentation Reference: &lt;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/18-tips-forkiller- presentations.html&gt; Becoming a competent, rather than just confident, speaker requires a lot of practice. But here are a few things you can consider to start sharpening your presentation skills: Slow Down – Nervous and inexperienced speakers tend to talk way to fast. Consciously slow your speech down and add pauses for emphasis. Eye Contact – Match eye contact with the person to whom you are presenting. 15 Word Summary – Can you summarize your idea in fifteen words? If not, rewrite it and try again. Speaking is often an inefficient medium for communicating statistical information, so know what the important fifteen words are so they can be repeated. Don’t Read – This one is a no brainer, but nervous presenters want to get away with it. If you don’t know your presentation, that doesn’t just make you more distracting, it shows you don’t really understand your message, a huge blow to any confidence the audience has in you. If you need subtle cues or notes to feel comfortable, that’s ok, but don’t’ read. Speeches are About Stories – Great speakers know how to use a story to create an emotional connection between ideas for the audience. Your research is a story, not just information. Project Your Voice - Nothing is worse than a speaker you can’t hear. Projecting your voice doesn’t mean yelling, rather standing up straight and letting your voice resonate on the air in your lungs rather than in the throat to produce a clearer sound. The poster session will be noisy. You will need to adjust your voice accordingly. Don’t Plan Gestures - Any gestures you use need to be an extension of your message and any emotions that message conveys. Planned gestures look false because they don’t match your other involuntary body cues. You are better off keeping your hands to your side. “That’s a Good Question” – You can use statements like “that’s a really good question” or “I’m glad you asked me that” to buy yourself a few moments to organize your response. Will the other people in the audience know you are using these filler sentences to reorder your thoughts? Probably not. And even if they do, it still makes the presentation more smooth than if you answer were littered with fillers like “um” and “ah”. Breathe In Not Out – Feeling the urge to use presentation killers like “um”, “ah”, or “you know”? Replace those with a pause taking a short breath in. The pause may seem a bit awkward, but the audience will barely notice it. Get Practice – Use peers or join Toastmasters (here) to practice your speaking skills regularly in front of an audience. Not only is it a fun time, but it will make you more competent and confident when you need to approach the podium. Don’t Apologize – Apologies are only useful if you’ve done something wrong. Don’t use them to excuse incompetence or humble yourself in front of an audience. Don’t apologize for your nervousness or a lack of preparation time. Most audience members can’t detect your anxiety, so don’t draw attention to it. Do Apologize if You’re Wrong – One caveat to the above rule is that you should apologize if you are late or shown to be incorrect. You want to seem confident, but don’t be a jerk about it. Put Yourself in the Audience - When writing your presentation, see it from the audience’s perspective. What might they not understand? What might seem boring? Be Entertaining – Presentations should be entertaining and informative. I’m not saying you should be silly or immature. But unlike an e-mail or article, people expect some appeal to their emotions. Simply reciting dry facts without any passion will make people less likely to pay attention. Have Fun - Sounds impossible? With a little practice you can inject your excitement for your work into your presentations. Enthusiasm is contagious. Poster Assignment Submit the title of your poster.
